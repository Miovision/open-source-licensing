Asterisk is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2<br>
and is also available under alternative licenses negotiated directly<br>
with Digium, Inc. If you obtained Asterisk under the GPL, then the GPL<br>
applies to all loadable Asterisk modules used on your system as well,<br>
except as defined below. The GPL (version 2) is included in this<br>
source tree in the file COPYING.<br>
<br>
This package also includes various components that are not part of<br>
Asterisk itself; these components are in the 'contrib' directory<br>
and its subdirectories. Most of these components are also<br>
distributed under the GPL version 2 as well, except for the following:<br>
<br>
contrib/firmware/iax/iaxy.bin:<br>
This file is Copyright (C) Digium, Inc. and is licensed for<br>
use with Digium IAXy hardware devices only. It can be<br>
distributed freely as long as the distribution is in the<br>
original form present in this package (not reformatted or<br>
modified).<br>
<br>
Digium, Inc. (formerly Linux Support Services) holds copyright<br>
and/or sufficient licenses to all components of the Asterisk<br>
package, and therefore can grant, at its sole discretion, the ability<br>
for companies, individuals, or organizations to create proprietary or<br>
Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may be dynamically linked at<br>
runtime with the portions of Asterisk which fall under our<br>
copyright/license umbrella, or are distributed under more flexible<br>
licenses than GPL.<br>
<br>
If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry --<br>
there is no requirement that you provide the same exception in your<br>
GPL'd products (although if you've written a module for Asterisk we<br>
would strongly encourage you to make the same exception that we do).<br>
<br>
Specific permission is also granted to link Asterisk with OpenSSL and<br>
OpenH323.<br>
<br>
In addition, Asterisk implements two management/control protocols: the<br>
Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and the Asterisk Gateway Interface<br>
(AGI). It is our belief that applications using these protocols to<br>
manage or control an Asterisk instance do not have to be licensed<br>
under the GPL or a compatible license, as we believe these protocols<br>
do not create a 'derivative work' as referred to in the GPL. However,<br>
should any court or other judiciary body find that these protocols do<br>
fall under the terms of the GPL, then we hereby grant you a license to<br>
use these protocols in combination with Asterisk in external<br>
applications licensed under any license you wish.<br>

redistribution of Asterisk source code obtained from Digium, you<br>
