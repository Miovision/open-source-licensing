<br>
NO WARRANTY!  This class is in the Public Domain.<br>
<br>
The www.saxproject.org explains:<br>
<br>
Copyright Status<br>
<br>
SAX is free!<br>
<br>
In fact, it's not possible to own a license to SAX, since it's been<br>
placed in the public domain.<br>
<br>
No Warranty<br>
<br>
Because SAX is released to the public domain, there is no warranty<br>
for the design or for the software implementation, to the extent<br>
permitted by applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing<br>
the copyright holders and/or other parties provide SAX "as is" without<br>
warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not<br>
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for<br>
a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and<br>
performance of SAX is with you. Should SAX prove defective, you assume<br>
the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.<br>
<br>
In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in<br>
writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify<br>
and/or redistribute SAX, be liable to you for damages, including any<br>
general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of<br>
the use or inability to use SAX (including but not limited to loss of<br>
data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or<br>
third parties or a failure of the SAX to operate with any other<br>
programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the<br>
possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
Copyright Disclaimers<br>
<br>
This page includes statements to that effect by David Megginson, who<br>
would have been able to claim copyright for the original work.<br>
<br>
SAX 1.0<br>
<br>
Version 1.0 of the Simple API for XML (SAX), created collectively by<br>
the membership of the XML-DEV mailing list, is hereby released into<br>
the public domain.<br>
<br>
No one owns SAX: you may use it freely in both commercial and<br>
non-commercial applications, bundle it with your software<br>
distribution, include it on a CD-ROM, list the source code in a book,<br>
mirror the documentation at your own web site, or use it in any other<br>
way you see fit.<br>

SAX 2.0<br>
<br>
I hereby abandon any property rights to SAX 2.0 (the Simple API for<br>
XML), and release all of the SAX 2.0 source code, compiled code, and<br>
documentation contained in this distribution into the Public<br>
Domain. SAX comes with NO WARRANTY or guarantee of fitness for any<br>
purpose.<br>
