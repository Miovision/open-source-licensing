<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license<br>
document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to<br>
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended<br>
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure<br>
the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies<br>
to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program<br>
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation<br>
software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You<br>
can apply it to your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our<br>
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom<br>
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you<br>
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you<br>
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that<br>
you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to<br>
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These<br>
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute<br>
copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or<br>
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You<br>
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you<br>
must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)<br>
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute<br>
and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that<br>
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If<br>
the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its<br>
recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any<br>
problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'<br>
reputations.<br>
<br>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We<br>
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will<br>
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program<br>
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be<br>
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification<br>
follow.<br>
<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice<br>
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the<br>
terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any<br>
such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the<br>
Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a<br>
work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with<br>
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,<br>
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running<br>
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered<br>
only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent<br>
of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends<br>
on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code<br>
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and<br>
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this<br>
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients<br>
of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you<br>
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,<br>
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such<br>
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that<br>
you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
* a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating<br>
that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
* b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part<br>
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties<br>
under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
* c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when<br>
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive<br>
use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement<br>
including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is<br>
no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that<br>
users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and<br>
telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if<br>
the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such<br>
an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to<br>
print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable<br>
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be<br>
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then<br>
this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you<br>
distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same<br>
sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the<br>
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose<br>
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to<br>
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a<br>
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the<br>
scope of this License.<br>
<br>
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under<br>
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections<br>
1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
* a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source<br>
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2<br>
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
* b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,<br>
to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of<br>
physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-<br>
readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily<br>
used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
* c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to<br>
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed<br>
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the<br>
program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in<br>
accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code<br>
means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control<br>
compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special<br>
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which<br>
the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the<br>
executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access<br>
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy<br>
the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source<br>
code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source<br>
along with the object code.<br>
<br>
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as<br>
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,<br>
modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will<br>
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties<br>
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not<br>
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full<br>
compliance.<br>
<br>
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed<br>
it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute<br>
the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law<br>
if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or<br>
distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you<br>
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and<br>
conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works<br>
based on it.<br>
<br>
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions<br>
on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not<br>
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.<br>
<br>
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute<br>
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and<br>
any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not<br>
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would<br>
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who<br>
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you<br>
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from<br>
distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented<br>
by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions<br>
to the wide range of software distributed through that system in<br>
reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the<br>
author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software<br>
through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be<br>
a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain<br>
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original<br>
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an<br>
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be<br>
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version<br>
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the<br>
Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs<br>
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask<br>
for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software<br>
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make<br>
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of<br>
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER<br>
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED<br>
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE<br>
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH<br>
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL<br>
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR<br>
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL<br>
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM<br>
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED<br>
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF<br>
THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR<br>
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free<br>
software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to<br>
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the<br>
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"<br>
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.<br>
Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author<br>
<br>
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it<br>
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)<br>
any later version.<br>
<br>
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT<br>
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or<br>
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for<br>
more details.<br>
<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with<br>
this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59<br>
Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when<br>
it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes<br>
with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free<br>
software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;<br>
type 'show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be<br>
called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>
<br>
signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989<br>
Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public<br>
License instead of this License.<br>
