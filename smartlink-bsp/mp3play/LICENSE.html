GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111, USA<br>
Everyone  is  permitted  to  copy  and distribute verbatim<br>
copies of this license document, but changing  it  is  not<br>
allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The  licenses  for most software are designed to take away<br>
your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU<br>
General Public License is intended to guarantee your free-<br>
dom to share and change free software--to  make  sure  the<br>
software  is  free for all its users.  This General Public<br>
License applies to most of the Free Software  Foundation's<br>
software  and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.  (Some other Free Software  Foundation  software<br>
is  covered  by  the  GNU  Library  General Public License<br>
instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to  free-<br>
dom,  not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed<br>
to make sure that  you  have  the  freedom  to  distribute<br>
copies  of  free  software (and charge for this service if<br>
you wish), that you receive source code or can get  it  if<br>
you  want  it,  that  you  can  change the software or use<br>
pieces of it in new free programs; and that you  know  you<br>
can do these things.<br>
<br>
To  protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that<br>
forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to  ask  you  to<br>
surrender  the  rights.   These  restrictions translate to<br>
certain responsibilities for you if you distribute  copies<br>
of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
For  example,  if you distribute copies of such a program,<br>
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the  recipients<br>
all  the  rights  that  you have.  You must make sure that<br>
they, too, receive or can get the source  code.   And  you<br>
must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
We  protect  your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the<br>
software, and (2) offer you this license which  gives  you<br>
legal  permission  to  copy,  distribute and/or modify the<br>
software.<br>
<br>
Also, for each author's protection and ours,  we  want  to<br>
make  certain  that  everyone understands that there is no<br>
warranty for this free software.  If the software is modi-<br>
fied by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients<br>
to know that what they have is not the original,  so  that<br>
any  problems introduced by others will not reflect on the<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
original authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
Finally, any free  program  is  threatened  constantly  by<br>
software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redis-<br>
tributors of  a  free  program  will  individually  obtain<br>
patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.<br>
To prevent this, we have made it  clear  that  any  patent<br>
must  be  licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed<br>
at all.<br>

and modification follow.<br>

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0. This License applies to any program or other work which<br>
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it<br>
may  be distributed under the terms of this General Public<br>
License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program<br>
or  work,  and  a "work based on the Program" means either<br>
the Program or any derivative work  under  copyright  law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion<br>
of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or trans-<br>
lated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the  term  "modification".)<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities  other than copying, distribution and modifica-<br>
tion are not covered by this License; they are outside its<br>
scope.   The act of running the Program is not restricted,<br>
and the output from the Program is  covered  only  if  its<br>
contents  constitute a work based on the Program (indepen-<br>
dent of having been made by running the Program).  Whether<br>
that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Pro-<br>
gram's source code as you receive it, in any medium,  pro-<br>
vided  that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on<br>
each copy an appropriate copyright notice  and  disclaimer<br>
of  warranty;  keep  intact  all the notices that refer to<br>
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and  give<br>
any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of  transferring<br>
a  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protec-<br>
tion in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of  the  Program  or<br>
any  portion  of it, thus forming a work based on the Pro-<br>
gram, and copy and distribute such modifications  or  work<br>
under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also<br>
meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
a)  You must cause the modified files to  carry  prominent<br>
notices  stating  that  you  changed the files and the<br>
date of any change.<br>
<br>
b)  You must cause any work that you  distribute  or  pub-<br>
lish,  that in whole or in part contains or is derived<br>
from the Program or any part thereof, to  be  licensed<br>
as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the<br>
terms of this License.<br>
<br>
c)  If the modified program normally reads commands inter-<br>
actively  when  run,  you  must cause it, when started<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GNU                            GPL                              3<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
GPL(GNU)             Free Software Foundation            GPL(GNU)<br>
<br>
<br>
running for such interactive use in the most  ordinary<br>
way,  to print or display an announcement including an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and a notice  that  there<br>
is  no  warranty  (or  else, saying that you provide a<br>
warranty) and that users may redistribute the  program<br>
under  these  conditions,  and telling the user how to<br>
view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the  Pro-<br>
gram itself is interactive but does not normally print<br>
such an announcement, your work based on  the  Program<br>
is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These  requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.<br>
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from<br>
the  Program, and can be reasonably considered independent<br>
and separate works in themselves, then this  License,  and<br>
its  terms,  do  not apply to those sections when you dis-<br>
tribute them as separate works.  But when  you  distribute<br>
the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must  be  on<br>
the  terms  of  this  License, whose permissions for other<br>
licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and<br>
every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights<br>
or contest your rights to work written  entirely  by  you;<br>
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the<br>
distribution of derivative or collective  works  based  on<br>
the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on<br>
the Program with the Program (or with a work based on  the<br>
Program)  on  a volume of a storage or distribution medium<br>
does not bring the other work  under  the  scope  of  this<br>
License.<br>
<br>
3.  You  may  copy  and  distribute the Program (or a work<br>
based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable<br>
form  under  the  terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided<br>
that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
a)  Accompany it with the complete corresponding  machine-<br>
readable  source code, which must be distributed under<br>
the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a  medium  cus-<br>
tomarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
b)  Accompany  it with a written offer, valid for at least<br>
three years, to give any third party, for a charge  no<br>
more  than  your  cost of physically performing source<br>
distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of  the<br>
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the<br>
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium  customar-<br>
ily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
c)  Accompany  it  with the information you received as to<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GNU                            GPL                              4<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GPL(GNU)             Free Software Foundation            GPL(GNU)<br>
<br>
<br>
the offer to  distribute  corresponding  source  code.<br>
(This  alternative  is  allowed only for noncommercial<br>
distribution and only if you received the  program  in<br>
object  code or executable form with such an offer, in<br>
accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the<br>
work  for  making  modifications to it.  For an executable<br>
work, complete source code means all the source  code  for<br>
all  modules  it  contains,  plus any associated interface<br>
definition files, plus the scripts used to control  compi-<br>
lation  and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code  distributed  need  not<br>
include  anything  that is normally distributed (in either<br>
source or binary form) with  the  major  components  (com-<br>
piler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which<br>
the executable runs, unless that component itself accompa-<br>
nies the executable.<br>
<br>
If  distribution  of  executable or object code is made by<br>
offering access to copy  from  a  designated  place,  then<br>
offering  equivalent  access  to copy the source code from<br>
the same place counts as distribution of the source  code,<br>
even  though  third  parties are not compelled to copy the<br>
source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the<br>
Program  except  as expressly provided under this License.<br>
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or  dis-<br>
tribute the Program is void, and will automatically termi-<br>
nate your rights under this License.  However, parties who<br>
have  received  copies,  or  rights,  from  you under this<br>
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as<br>
such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
5.  You are not required to accept this License, since you<br>
have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you per-<br>
mission to modify or distribute the Program or its deriva-<br>
tive works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do<br>
not  accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or dis-<br>
tributing the Program (or any work based on the  Program),<br>
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing  or<br>
modifying the Program or works based on it.<br>

6.  Each  time  you  redistribute the Program (or any work<br>
based  on  the  Program),  the   recipient   automatically<br>
receives  a  license  from  the original licensor to copy,<br>
distribute or modify the Program subject  to  these  terms<br>
and  conditions.   You may not impose any further restric-<br>
tions on the recipients' exercise of  the  rights  granted<br>
herein.   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance<br>
by third parties to this License.<br>
<br>
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or  allegation<br>
of  patent  infringement or for any other reason (not lim-<br>
ited to patent issues),  conditions  are  imposed  on  you<br>
(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that con-<br>
tradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse<br>
you  from  the  conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy  simultaneously  your  obliga-<br>
tions  under  this License and any other pertinent obliga-<br>
tions, then as a consequence you may  not  distribute  the<br>
Program  at  all.   For example, if a patent license would<br>
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the  Program  by<br>
all  those  who  receive  copies  directly  or  indirectly<br>
through you, then the only way you could satisfy  both  it<br>
and this License would be to refrain entirely from distri-<br>
bution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held  invalid  or  unen-<br>
forceable  under  any particular circumstance, the balance<br>
of the section is intended to apply and the section  as  a<br>
whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It  is  not  the  purpose of this section to induce you to<br>
infringe any patents or other property right claims or  to<br>
contest  validity of any such claims; this section has the<br>
sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free soft-<br>
ware  distribution  system, which is implemented by public<br>
license practices.  Many people have made generous contri-<br>
butions  to the wide range of software distributed through<br>
that system in reliance on consistent application of  that<br>
system;  it  is  up to the author/donor to decide if he or<br>
she is willing to distribute software  through  any  other<br>
system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This  section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is<br>
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this  License.<br>

8.  If  the  distribution  and/or  use  of  the Program is<br>
restricted in certain countries either by  patents  or  by<br>
copyrighted  interfaces, the original copyright holder who<br>
places the Program under this License may add an  explicit<br>
geographical distribution limitation excluding those coun-<br>
tries, so that distribution is permitted only in or  among<br>
countries  not  thus excluded.  In such case, this License<br>
incorporates the limitation as if written in the  body  of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or<br>
new versions of the General Public License  from  time  to<br>
time.   Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the<br>
present version, but may differ in detail to  address  new<br>
problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If<br>
the Program specifies a version  number  of  this  License<br>
which  applies to it and "any later version", you have the<br>
option of following the terms  and  conditions  either  of<br>
that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.  If the Program does  not  specify  a<br>
version number of this License, you may choose any version<br>
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the  Program  into<br>
other free programs whose distribution conditions are dif-<br>
ferent, write to the author to ask  for  permission.   For<br>
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Founda-<br>
tion, write to the Free Software Foundation; we  sometimes<br>
make  exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by<br>
the two goals of preserving the free status of all deriva-<br>
tives  of  our  free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,  THERE<br>
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED  IN  WRITING<br>
THE  COPYRIGHT  HOLDERS  AND/OR  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE<br>
PROGRAM "AS IS"  WITHOUT  WARRANTY  OF  ANY  KIND,  EITHER<br>
EXPRESSED  OR  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND  FITNESS  FOR  A<br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND<br>
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD  THE  PRO-<br>
GRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY<br>
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
12. IN NO EVENT  UNLESS  REQUIRED  BY  APPLICABLE  LAW  OR<br>
AGREED  TO  IN  WRITING  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY<br>
OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM<br>
AS  PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUD-<br>
ING ANY  GENERAL,  SPECIAL,  INCIDENTAL  OR  CONSEQUENTIAL<br>

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the<br>
greatest  possible  use  to  the  public,  the best way to<br>
achieve this is to make it free  software  which  everyone<br>
can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It<br>
is safest to attach them to the start of each source  file<br>
to  most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and<br>
each file should have at least the "copyright" line and  a<br>
pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
< one line to give the program's name and a brief idea<br>
of what it does.  ><br>
Copyright (C) 19yy < name of author ><br>
<br>
This program is free software; you can redistribute it<br>
and/or  modify  it  under the terms of the GNU General<br>
Public License as published by the Free Software Foun-<br>
dation;  either  version 2 of the License, or (at your<br>
option) any later version.<br>
<br>
This program is distributed in the hope that  it  will<br>
be  useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the<br>
implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS  FOR  A<br>

License for more details.<br>
<br>
You should have received a copy  of  the  GNU  General<br>
Public  License along with this program; if not, write<br>
to the  Free  Software  Foundation,  Inc.,  59  Temple<br>
Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111, USA.<br>
<br>
Also  add  information on how to contact you by electronic<br>
and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive,  make  it  output  a  short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
Gnomovision  version  69,  Copyright  (C) 19yy name of<br>

are welcome to redistribute it  under  certain  condi-<br>
tions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The  hypothetical  commands  `show  w' and `show c' should<br>
show the appropriate parts of the General Public  License.<br>
Of  course,  the  commands you use may be called something<br>
other than `show w' and  `show  c';  they  could  even  be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>

You  should  also get your employer (if you work as a pro-<br>
grammer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright dis-<br>
claimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here is a sample;<br>
alter the names:<br>

This General Public License does not permit  incorporating<br>
your  program  into proprietary programs.  If your program<br>
is a subroutine library, you may consider it  more  useful<br>
to   permit  linking  proprietary  applications  with  the<br>
library.  If this is what you want  to  do,  use  the  GNU<br>
Library General Public License instead of this License.<br>
