<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
========<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom<br>
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is<br>
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.<br>
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have<br>
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this<br>
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone<br>
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These<br>
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you<br>
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will<br>
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program<br>
proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent<br>
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a<br>
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",<br>
below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on<br>
the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or<br>
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each<br>
licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are<br>
not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act<br>
of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the<br>
Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on<br>
the Program (independent of having been made by running the<br>
Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of<br>
this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange<br>
for a fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that<br>
in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program<br>
or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge<br>
to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display<br>
an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and<br>
a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you<br>
provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the<br>
program under these conditions, and telling the user how to<br>
view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program<br>
itself is interactive but does not normally print such an<br>
announcement, your work based on the Program is not required<br>
to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the<br>
Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate<br>
works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not<br>
apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate<br>
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a<br>
whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of<br>
the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions<br>
for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each<br>
and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or<br>
contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the<br>
intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of<br>
derivative or collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the<br>
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on<br>
a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the<br>
other work under the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms<br>
of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the<br>
following:<br>
<br>
a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for<br>
software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
years, to give any third-party, for a charge no more than your<br>
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
received the program in object code or executable form with<br>
such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete<br>
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,<br>
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts<br>
used to control compilation and installation of the executable.<br>
However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need<br>
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either<br>
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,<br>
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable<br>
runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this<br>
License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,<br>
from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify<br>
or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions<br>
are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.<br>
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work<br>
based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this<br>
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,<br>
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any<br>
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights<br>
granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance<br>
by third parties to this License.<br>
<br>
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent<br>
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,<br>
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this<br>
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this<br>
License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously<br>
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent<br>
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the<br>
Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit<br>
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who<br>
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only<br>
way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain<br>
entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable<br>
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is<br>
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply<br>
in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of<br>
any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting<br>
the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is<br>
willing to distribute software through any other system and a<br>
licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed<br>
to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,<br>
the original copyright holder who places the Program under this<br>
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation<br>
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only<br>
in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this<br>
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such<br>
new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but<br>
may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies<br>
to it and "any later version", you have the option of following<br>
the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later<br>
version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program<br>
does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose<br>
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the<br>
author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted<br>
by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software<br>
Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision<br>
will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of<br>
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE<br>
LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT<br>
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT<br>
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND<br>
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE<br>
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY<br>
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY<br>
MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE<br>
LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,<br>
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR<br>
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU<br>
OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY<br>
OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN<br>
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these<br>
terms.<br>
<br>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to<br>
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey<br>
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.<br>
Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR<br>
<br>
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
(at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR<br>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the<br>
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the<br>
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show<br>
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your<br>
program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>
<br>
SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989<br>
Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,<br>
you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary<br>
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the<br>
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.<br>
