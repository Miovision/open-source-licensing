PCRE LICENCE<br>
------------<br>
<br>
PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax<br>
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.<br>
<br>
Release 6 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as<br>
specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"<br>
directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself.<br>
<br>
The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also<br>
included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions.<br>
