GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
Sections above.<br>
<br>
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
