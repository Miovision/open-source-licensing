HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE<br>
=======================<br>
<br>
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting<br>
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor of a<br>
language called ABC.  Guido is Python's principal author, although it<br>
includes many contributions from others.  The last version released<br>
from CWI was Python 1.2.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python<br>
at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston,<br>
Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  Python<br>
1.6 was the last of the versions released by CNRI.  In 2000, Guido and<br>
the Python core developement team moved to BeOpen.com to form the<br>
BeOpen PythonLabs team (www.pythonlabs.com).  Python 2.0 is the first<br>
release from PythonLabs.  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who<br>
have worked under Guido's direction to make this release possible.<br>
