GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
<br>
Version 2, June 1991<br>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom<br>
to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is<br>
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br>
you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,<br>
we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the<br>
original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect<br>
on the original authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at<br>
all.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a<br>
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program<br>
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that<br>
is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source<br>
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously<br>
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice<br>
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to<br>
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other<br>
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the<br>
Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of<br>
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute<br>
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,<br>
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
* a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
* b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
parties under the terms of this License.<br>
* c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does<br>
not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the<br>
Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
* a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software<br>
interchange; or,<br>
* b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
* c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is<br>
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise<br>
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and<br>
will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,<br>
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this<br>
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>
generous contrribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,<br>
we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the<br>
original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect<br>
on the original authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
