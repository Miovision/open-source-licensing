This documents purpose is to state the conditions under which this<br>
Package (See definition below) viz: "Shadow", the Shadow Password Suite<br>
which is held by Julianne Frances Haugh, may be copied, such that the<br>
copyright holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the<br>
development of the package, while giving the users of the package the<br>
right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary<br>
fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.<br>
<br>
So there.<br>

<br>
Definitions:<br>
<br>
<br>
A "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the<br>
Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created<br>
through textual modification, or segments thereof.<br>
<br>
"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified,<br>
or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright<br>
Holder.<br>
<br>
"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights<br>
for the package.<br>
<br>
"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this<br>
Package.<br>
<br>
"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of<br>
media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on.<br>
(You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but<br>
only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the<br>
fee.)<br>
<br>
"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself,<br>
though there may be fees involved in handling the item.  It also means<br>
that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same<br>
conditions they received it.<br>
<br>
<br>
1.  You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the<br>
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you<br>
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated<br>
disclaimers.<br>
<br>
2.  You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications<br>
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package<br>
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.<br>
<br>
3.  You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,<br>
provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating<br>
how and when AND WHY you changed that file, and provided that you do at<br>
least ONE of the following:<br>
<br>
a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them<br>
Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an<br>
equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site<br>
such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include<br>
your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.<br>
<br>
b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.<br>
<br>
c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with<br>
standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide separate<br>
documentation for each non-standard executable that clearly documents<br>
how it differs from the Standard Version.<br>
<br>
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.<br>
<br>
4.  You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or<br>
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:<br>
<br>
a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,<br>
together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where<br>
to get the Standard Version.<br>
<br>
b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the<br>
Package with your modifications.<br>
<br>
c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding<br>
Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables<br>
non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual<br>
pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the<br>
Standard Version.<br>
<br>
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.<br>
<br>
5.  You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this<br>
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.<br>
YOU MAY NOT CHARGE A FEE FOR THIS PACKAGE ITSELF.  However, you may<br>
distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)<br>
programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution<br>
provided that YOU DO NOT ADVERTISE this package as a product of your<br>
own.<br>
<br>
6.  The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or<br>
promote products derived from this software without specific prior<br>
written permission.<br>

MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br>
