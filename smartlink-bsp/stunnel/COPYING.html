Linking stunnel statically or dynamically with other modules is making<br>
a combined work based on stunnel. Thus, the terms and conditions of the<br>
GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.<br>
<br>
In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holder of stunnel gives you<br>
permission to combine stunnel with free software programs or libraries that<br>
are released under the GNU LGPL and with code included in the standard release<br>
of OpenSSL under the OpenSSL License (or modified versions of such code, with<br>
unchanged license). You may copy and distribute such a system following the<br>
terms of the GNU GPL for stunnel and the licenses of the other code concerned.<br>
<br>
Note that people who make modified versions of stunnel are not obligated to<br>
grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is their choice<br>
whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives permission to release<br>
a modified version without this exception; this exception also makes it<br>
possible to release a modified version which carries forward this exception.<br>
