/* Notice of general intent:<br>
*<br>
* The linux operating system generally contains large amounts of code<br>
* that fall under the GNU General Public License, or GPL for short.<br>
* This file contains source code that by it's very nature would always<br>
* be linked with an application program, and because of this a GPL<br>
* type of copyright on this file would place restrictions upon the<br>
* distribution of binary-only commercial software.  Since the goal of<br>
* the Linux project as a whole is not to discourage the development and<br>
* distribution of commercial software for Linux, this file has been<br>
* placed under a more relaxed BSD-style of copyright.<br>
*<br>
* It is the general understanding of the above contributors that a<br>
* program executable linked to a library containing code that falls<br>
* under the GPL or GLPL style of license is not subject to the terms of<br>
* the GPL or GLPL license if the program executable(s) that are supplied<br>
* are linked to a shared library form of the GPL or GLPL library, and as<br>
* long as the form of the shared library is such that it is possible for<br>
* the end user to modify and rebuild the library and use it in<br>
* conjunction with the program executable.<br>
