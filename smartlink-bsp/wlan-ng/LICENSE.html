<br>
3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
<br>
3.1. Application of License.<br>
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are<br>
governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation<br>
Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed<br>
only under the terms of this License or a future version of this<br>
License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this<br>
License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not<br>
offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or<br>
restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'<br>
rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document<br>
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.<br>
<br>
3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br>
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be<br>
made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License<br>
either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted<br>
Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an<br>
Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic<br>
Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)<br>
months after the date it initially became available, or at least six<br>
(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification<br>
has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for<br>
ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the<br>
Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<br>
<br>
3.3. Description of Modifications.<br>
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a<br>
file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and<br>
the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the<br>
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code<br>
provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial<br>
Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an<br>
Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the<br>
origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br>
<br>
(a) Third Party Claims.<br>
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's<br>
intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights<br>
granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor<br>
must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled<br>
"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim<br>
in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.<br>
If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is<br>
made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall<br>
promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes<br>
available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying<br>
appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to<br>
inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has<br>
been obtained.<br>
<br>
(b) Contributor APIs.<br>
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming<br>
interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which<br>
are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must<br>
also include this information in the LEGAL file.<br>
<br>
(c) Representations.<br>
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to<br>
Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's<br>
Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or<br>
Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
3.5. Required Notices.<br>
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source<br>
Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source<br>
Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a<br>
location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to<br>
look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You<br>
may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit<br>
A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the<br>
Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights<br>
relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee<br>
for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or<br>
more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your<br>
own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any<br>
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,<br>
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and<br>
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every<br>
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such<br>
Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br>
terms You offer.<br>
<br>
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br>
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,<br>
and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the<br>
Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a<br>
description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of<br>
Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in<br>
an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You<br>
describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may<br>
distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights<br>
under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from<br>
this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of<br>
this License and that the license for the Executable version does not<br>
attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code<br>
version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute<br>
the Executable version under a different license You must make it<br>
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are<br>
offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.<br>
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every<br>
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such<br>
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.<br>
<br>
3.7. Larger Works.<br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code<br>
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<br>
Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the<br>
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br>
<br>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br>
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,<br>
judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms<br>
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the<br>
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included<br>
in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with<br>
all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited<br>
by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently<br>
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br>
<br>
5. Application of this License.<br>
<br>
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<br>
attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.<br>
<br>
6. Versions of the License.<br>
<br>
6.1. New Versions.<br>
Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish revised<br>
and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will<br>
be given a distinguishing version number.<br>
<br>
6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the<br>
License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that<br>
version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms<br>
of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one<br>
other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to<br>
Covered Code created under this License.<br>
<br>
6.3. Derivative Works.<br>
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may<br>
only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code<br>
governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the<br>
phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL",<br>
''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license<br>
(except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b)<br>
otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms<br>
which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public<br>
License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code<br>
or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of<br>
themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)<br>
<br>
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>
<br>
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS,<br>
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br>
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF<br>
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.<br>
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE<br>
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,<br>
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE<br>
COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER<br>
OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF<br>
ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br>
<br>
8. TERMINATION.<br>
<br>
8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br>
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All<br>
sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall<br>
survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their<br>
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<br>
shall survive.<br>
<br>
8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement<br>
claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer<br>
or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You<br>
file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:<br>
<br>
(a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly<br>
infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such<br>
Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,<br>
upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if<br>
within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)  agree in<br>
writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for<br>
Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or<br>
(ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor<br>
Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a<br>
reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon<br>
in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the<br>
rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2<br>
automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period<br>
specified above.<br>
<br>
(b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's<br>
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then<br>
any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and<br>
2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,<br>
distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.<br>
<br>
8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant<br>
alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or<br>
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as<br>
by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent<br>
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses<br>
granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken<br>
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or<br>
license.<br>
<br>
8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all<br>
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)<br>
which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder<br>
prior to termination shall survive termination.<br>
<br>
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
<br>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<br>
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL<br>
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,<br>
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY<br>
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY<br>
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,<br>
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER<br>
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN<br>
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF<br>
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<br>
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW<br>
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br>
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS<br>
EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>
<br>
The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in<br>
48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer<br>
software'' and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such<br>
terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48<br>
C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),<br>
all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those<br>
rights set forth herein.<br>
<br>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
<br>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject<br>
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br>
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br>
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by<br>
California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,<br>
provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With<br>
respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an<br>
entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of<br>
America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to<br>
the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of<br>
California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with<br>
the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,<br>
court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The<br>
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the<br>
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or<br>
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be<br>
construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.<br>
<br>
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br>
<br>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is<br>
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out<br>
of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work<br>
with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such<br>
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or<br>
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<br>
<br>
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.<br>
<br>
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as<br>
"Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial<br>
Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under<br>
Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified<br>
by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.<br>

IV. Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation.<br>
Prior to licensing the Original Code under this License, Netscape<br>
has licensed third party code for use in Netscape's Branded Code.<br>
To the extent that Netscape is limited contractually from making<br>
such third party code available under this License, Netscape may<br>
choose to reintegrate such code into Covered Code without being<br>

the terms of this License, and may license such additional<br>
products on different terms from those contained in this<br>
License.<br>
<br>
V.3. Alternative Licensing.<br>
Netscape may license the Source Code of Netscape's Branded<br>
Code, including Modifications incorporated therein, without<br>
