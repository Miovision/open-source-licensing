Alan Beale <biljir@pobox.com> also deserves special credit as he has,<br>
in addition to providing the 12Dicts package and being a major<br>
contributor to the ENABLE word list, given me an incredible amount of<br>
feedback and created a number of special lists (those found in the<br>
Supplement) in order to help improve the overall quality of SCOWL.<br>
<br>
The 10 level includes the 1000 most common English words (according to<br>
the Moby (TM) Words II [MWords] package), a subset of the 1000 most<br>
common words on the Internet (again, according to Moby Words II), and<br>
frequently class 16 from Brian Kelk's "UK English Wordlist<br>
with Frequency Classification".<br>
<br>
The MWords package was explicitly placed in the public domain:<br>

The Moby lexicon project is complete and has<br>
been place into the public domain. Use, sell,<br>
rework, excerpt and use in any way on any platform.<br>

From: Brian Kelk <Brian.Kelk@cl.cam.ac.uk><br>
<br>
> I was wondering what the copyright status of your "UK English<br>
> Wordlist With Frequency Classification" word list as it seems to<br>
> be lacking any copyright notice.<br>
<br>
There were many many sources in total, but any text marked<br>
"copyright" was avoided. Locally-written documentation was one<br>
source. An earlier version of the list resided in a filespace called<br>
PUBLIC on the University mainframe, because it was considered public<br>
domain.<br>

<br>
> So are you saying your word list is also in the public domain?<br>
<br>
That is the intention.<br>
<br>
The 20 level includes frequency classes 7-15 from Brian's word list.<br>
<br>
The 35 level includes frequency classes 2-6 and words appearing in at<br>
least 11 of 12 dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package.  All<br>
words from the 12Dicts package have had likely inflections added via<br>
my inflection database.<br>

top 1000 male, female, and Last names from the 1990 Census report; a<br>
list of names sent to me by Alan Beale; and a few names that I added<br>
myself.  Finally a small list of abbreviations not commonly found in<br>
other word lists is included.<br>
<br>
The name files form the Census report is a government document which I<br>
don't think can be copyrighted.<br>
<br>
