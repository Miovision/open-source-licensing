Under Section 7 of GPL version 3, you are granted additional<br>
permissions described in the Autoconf Configure Script Exception,<br>
version 3.0, as published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
.<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
and a copy of the Autoconf Configure Script Exception along with<br>
this program; see the files COPYINGv3 and COPYING.EXCEPTION<br>
respectively.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>

The Autoconf Configure Script Exception version 3 is below:<br>
.<br>
AUTOCONF CONFIGURE SCRIPT EXCEPTION<br>
Version 3.0, 18 August 2009<br>
.<br>
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
.<br>
This Exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU<br>
General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3").  It applies to a given<br>
file that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file<br>
stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.<br>
.<br>
The purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of Autoconf's<br>
typical output under terms of the recipient's choice (including<br>
proprietary).<br>
.<br>
0. Definitions<br>
.<br>
"Covered Code" is the source or object code of a version of Autoconf<br>
that is a covered work under this License.<br>
.<br>
"Normally Copied Code" for a version of Autoconf means all parts of<br>
its Covered Code which that version can copy from its code (i.e., not<br>
from its input file) into its minimally verbose, non-debugging and<br>
non-tracing output.<br>
.<br>
"Ineligible Code" is Covered Code that is not Normally Copied Code.<br>
.<br>
1. Grant of Additional Permission.<br>
.<br>
You have permission to propagate output of Autoconf, even if such<br>
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3.  However, if<br>
by modifying Autoconf you cause any Ineligible Code of the version you<br>
received to become Normally Copied Code of your modified version, then<br>
you void this Exception for the resulting covered work.  If you convey<br>
that resulting covered work, you must remove this Exception in accordance<br>
with the second paragraph of Section 7 of GPLv3.<br>
.<br>
2. No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.<br>
.<br>
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption<br>
that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of<br>
the license of Autoconf.<br>
