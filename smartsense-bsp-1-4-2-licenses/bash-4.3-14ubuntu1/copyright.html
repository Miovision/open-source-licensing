This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of the FSF's GNU Bash,<br>
the Bourne Again SHell.<br>
<br>
This package was put together by Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org>, from<br>
the following sources:<br>
<br>
bash:			ftp.gnu.org:/pub/gnu/bash/bash-4.3.tar.gz<br>
<br>
Bash homepage:		 http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html<br>

<br>
The Free Software Foundation has exempted Bash from the requirement of<br>
Paragraph 2c of the General Public License.  This is to say, there is<br>
no requirement for Bash to print a notice when it is started<br>
interactively in the usual way.  We made this exception because users<br>
and standards expect shells not to print such messages.  This<br>
exception applies to any program that serves as a shell and that is<br>
based primarily on Bash as opposed to other GNU software.<br>
