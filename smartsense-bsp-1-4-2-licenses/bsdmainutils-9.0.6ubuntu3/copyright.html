This is a collection of programs from 4.4BSD-Lite that have not (yet)<br>
been re-written by FSF as GNU.  It was constructed for inclusion in<br>
Debian Linux.  As programs found here become available from GNU sources,<br>
they will be replaced.<br>
<br>
This package was originally put together by Austin Donnelly<br>
<and1000@debian.org>, but is heavily based on bsdutils, originally put<br>
together by Ian Murdock <imurdock@gnu.ai.mit.edu>.  Please report any<br>
problems or suggested additions or changes to Austin Donnelly.<br>
<br>
Then the package has been maintained by Charles Briscoe-Smith<br>
<cpbs@debian.org>.  I gathered data for the 1999-2001 calendar files<br>
from various sources on the Internet, and I'd also like to thank Oliver<br>
Elphick, Julian Gilbey, Daniel Martin and Jaldhar H. Vyas for providing<br>
much useful data on the various religous calendars.  I have edited the<br>
files they provided to fit calendar's requirements, so any errors should<br>
be attributed to me.<br>
<br>
After cpbs@debian.org, Marco d'Itri <md@linux.it> maintained it for<br>
almost two years, before Tollef Fog Heen <tfheen@debian.org> took over.<br>
The package is now maintained by Graham Wilson <bob@decoy.wox.org>.<br>
