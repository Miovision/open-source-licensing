GNU Free Documentation License<br>
Version 1.1, March 2000<br>
.<br>
Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
.<br>
0. PREAMBLE<br>
.<br>
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other<br>
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone<br>
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without<br>
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,<br>
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get<br>
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for<br>
modifications made by others.<br>
.<br>
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative<br>
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It<br>
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft<br>
license designed for free software.<br>
.<br>
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free<br>
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free<br>
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the<br>
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;<br>
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or<br>
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License<br>
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.<br>
.<br>
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS<br>
.<br>
This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a<br>
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed<br>
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any<br>
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is<br>
addressed as "you".<br>
.<br>
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the<br>
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with<br>
modifications and/or translated into another language.<br>
.<br>
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of<br>
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the<br>
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject<br>
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly<br>
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a<br>
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any<br>
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical<br>
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,<br>
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding<br>
them.<br>
.<br>
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles<br>
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice<br>
that says that the Document is released under this License.<br>
.<br>
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,<br>
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that<br>
the Document is released under this License.<br>
.<br>
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,<br>
represented in a format whose specification is available to the<br>
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and<br>
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of<br>
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available<br>
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or<br>
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input<br>
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file<br>
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage<br>
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is<br>
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".<br>
.<br>
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain<br>
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML<br>
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple<br>
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include<br>
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only<br>
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or<br>
processing tools are not generally available, and the<br>
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output<br>
purposes only.<br>
.<br>
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,<br>
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material<br>
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in<br>
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means<br>
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,<br>
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.<br>
.<br>
2. VERBATIM COPYING<br>
.<br>
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either<br>
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the<br>
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies<br>
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other<br>
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use<br>
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further<br>
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept<br>
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough<br>
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.<br>
.<br>
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and<br>
you may publicly display copies.<br>
.<br>
3. COPYING IN QUANTITY<br>
.<br>
If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,<br>
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose<br>
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover<br>
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on<br>
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify<br>
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present<br>
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and<br>
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.<br>
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve<br>
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated<br>
as verbatim copying in other respects.<br>
.<br>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit<br>
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit<br>
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent<br>
pages.<br>
.<br>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering<br>
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent<br>
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy<br>
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete<br>
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the<br>
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no<br>
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter<br>
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin<br>
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this<br>
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location<br>
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque<br>
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to<br>
the public.<br>
.<br>
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the<br>
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give<br>
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.<br>
.<br>
4. MODIFICATIONS<br>
.<br>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under<br>
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release<br>
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified<br>
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution<br>
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy<br>
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:<br>
.<br>
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct<br>
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions<br>
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section<br>
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version<br>
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.<br>
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities<br>
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified<br>
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the<br>
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).<br>
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the<br>
Modified Version, as the publisher.<br>
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.<br>
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications<br>
adjacent to the other copyright notices.<br>
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice<br>
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the<br>
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.<br>
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections<br>
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.<br>
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.<br>
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to<br>
it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and<br>
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If<br>
there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one<br>
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as<br>
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified<br>
Version as stated in the previous sentence.<br>
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for<br>
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise<br>
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions<br>
it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.<br>
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at<br>
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original<br>
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.<br>
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",<br>
preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the<br>
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements<br>
and/or dedications given therein.<br>
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,<br>
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers<br>
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.<br>
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section<br>
may not be included in the Modified Version.<br>
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"<br>
or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.<br>
.<br>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or<br>
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material<br>
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all<br>
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the<br>
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.<br>
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.<br>
.<br>
You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains<br>
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various<br>
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has<br>
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a<br>
standard.<br>
.<br>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a<br>
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list<br>
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of<br>
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or<br>
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already<br>
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or<br>
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,<br>
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit<br>
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.<br>
.<br>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License<br>
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or<br>
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.<br>
.<br>
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS<br>
.<br>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this<br>
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified<br>
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the<br>
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and<br>
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its<br>
license notice.<br>
.<br>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and<br>
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single<br>
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but<br>
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by<br>
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original<br>
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.<br>
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of<br>
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.<br>
.<br>
In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"<br>
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled<br>
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",<br>
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections<br>
entitled "Endorsements."<br>
.<br>
6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS<br>
.<br>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents<br>
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this<br>
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in<br>
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for<br>
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.<br>
.<br>
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute<br>
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this<br>
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all<br>
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.<br>
.<br>
7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS<br>
.<br>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate<br>
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or<br>
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version<br>
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the<br>
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this<br>
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled<br>
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they<br>
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.<br>
.<br>
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these<br>
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter<br>
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on<br>
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.<br>
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.<br>
.<br>
8. TRANSLATION<br>
.<br>
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may<br>
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.<br>
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special<br>
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include<br>
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the<br>
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a<br>
translation of this License provided that you also include the<br>
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement<br>
between the translation and the original English version of this<br>
License, the original English version will prevail.<br>
.<br>
9. TERMINATION<br>
.<br>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except<br>
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to<br>
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will<br>
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,<br>
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this<br>
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
.<br>
10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE<br>
.<br>
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions<br>
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See<br>
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.<br>
.<br>
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.<br>
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this<br>
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of<br>
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or<br>
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the<br>
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version<br>
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not<br>
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
.<br>
ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents<br>
.<br>
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of<br>
the License in the document and put the following copyright and<br>
license notices just after the title page:<br>
.<br>
Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.<br>
Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document<br>
under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1<br>
or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;<br>
with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the<br>
Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.<br>
A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU<br>
Free Documentation License".<br>
.<br>
If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"<br>
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no<br>
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of<br>
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.<br>
.<br>
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we<br>
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of<br>
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,<br>
to permit their use in free software.<br>

License: CC0<br>
Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal<br>
CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE<br>
LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN<br>
ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION<br>
ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE<br>
USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND<br>
DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT<br>
OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.<br>
.<br>
Statement of Purpose<br>
.<br>
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer<br>
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator<br>
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work<br>
of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").<br>
.<br>
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for<br>
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and<br>
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without<br>
fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in<br>
other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form<br>
whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial<br>
purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the<br>
ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural<br>
and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for<br>
their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.<br>
.<br>
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any<br>
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person<br>
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or<br>
she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily<br>
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under<br>
its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in<br>
the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those<br>
rights.<br>
.<br>
1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be<br>
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and<br>
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not<br>
limited to, the following:<br>
.<br>
i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,<br>
communicate, and translate a Work;<br>
.<br>
ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);<br>
.<br>
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or<br>
likeness depicted in a Work;<br>
.<br>
iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,<br>
subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;<br>
.<br>
v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of<br>
data in a Work;<br>
.<br>
vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of<br>
the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal<br>
protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,<br>
including any amended or successor version of such directive); and<br>
.<br>
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the<br>
world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national<br>
implementations thereof.<br>
.<br>
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention<br>
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,<br>
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of<br>
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes<br>
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as<br>
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories<br>
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or<br>
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or<br>
future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose<br>
whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or<br>
promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the<br>
benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of<br>
Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall<br>
not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or<br>
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of<br>
the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement<br>
of Purpose.<br>
.<br>
3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason<br>
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the<br>
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into<br>
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the<br>
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected<br>
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non<br>
exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's<br>
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories<br>
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or<br>
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or<br>
future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose<br>
whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or<br>
promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed<br>
effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should<br>
any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or<br>
ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or<br>
ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and<br>
in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)<br>
exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the<br>
Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with<br>
respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express<br>
Statement of Purpose.<br>
.<br>
4. Limitations and Disclaimers.<br>
.<br>
a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,<br>
