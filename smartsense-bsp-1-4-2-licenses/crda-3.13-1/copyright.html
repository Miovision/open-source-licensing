Release date: 2013-05-16<br>
.<br>
1. License Grants; No Trademark License<br>
.<br>
Subject to the terms of this License, I grant You:<br>
.<br>
a) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
copyright license, to reproduce, Distribute, prepare derivative works<br>
of, publicly perform and publicly display My Work.<br>
.<br>
b) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
patent license under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell,<br>
offer for sale, and import Covered Works.<br>
.<br>
This License does not grant any rights in My name, trademarks, service<br>
marks, or logos.<br>
.<br>
2. Distribution: General Conditions<br>
.<br>
You may Distribute Covered Works, provided that You (i) inform<br>
recipients how they can obtain a copy of this License; (ii) satisfy the<br>
applicable conditions of sections 3 through 6; and (iii) preserve all<br>
Legal Notices contained in My Work (to the extent they remain<br>
pertinent). "Legal Notices" means copyright notices, license notices,<br>
license texts, and author attributions, but does not include logos,<br>
other graphical images, trademarks or trademark legends.<br>
.<br>
3. Conditions for Distributing Derived Works; Outbound GPL Compatibility<br>
.<br>
If You Distribute a Derived Work, You must license the entire Derived<br>
Work as a whole under this License, with prominent notice of such<br>
licensing. This condition may not be avoided through such means as<br>
separate Distribution of portions of the Derived Work. You may<br>
additionally license the Derived Work under the GPL, so that the<br>
recipient may further Distribute the Derived Work under either this<br>
License or the GPL.<br>
.<br>
4. Condition Against Further Restrictions; Inbound License Compatibility<br>
.<br>
When Distributing a Covered Work, You may not impose further<br>
restrictions on the exercise of rights in the Covered Work granted under<br>
this License. This condition is not excused merely because such<br>
restrictions result from Your compliance with conditions or obligations<br>
extrinsic to this License (such as a court order or an agreement with a<br>
third party).<br>
.<br>
However, You may Distribute a Covered Work incorporating material<br>
governed by a license that is both OSI-Approved and FSF-Free as of the<br>
release date of this License, provided that Your Distribution complies<br>
with such other license.<br>
.<br>
5. Conditions for Distributing Object Code<br>
.<br>
You may Distribute an Object Code form of a Covered Work, provided that<br>
you accompany the Object Code with a URL through which the Corresponding<br>
Source is made available, at no charge, by some standard or customary<br>
means of providing network access to source code.<br>
.<br>
If you Distribute the Object Code in a physical product or tangible<br>
storage medium ("Product"), the Corresponding Source must be available<br>
through such URL for two years from the date of Your most recent<br>
Distribution of the Object Code in the Product. However, if the Product<br>
itself contains or is accompanied by the Corresponding Source (made<br>
available in a customarily accessible manner), You need not also comply<br>
with the first paragraph of this section.<br>
.<br>
Each recipient of the Covered Work from You is an intended third-party<br>
beneficiary of this License solely as to this section 5, with the right<br>
to enforce its terms.<br>
.<br>
6. Symmetrical Licensing Condition for Upstream Contributions<br>
.<br>
If You Distribute a work to Me specifically for inclusion in or<br>
modification of a Covered Work (a "Patch"), and no explicit licensing<br>
terms apply to the Patch, You license the Patch under this License, to<br>
the extent of Your copyright in the Patch. This condition does not<br>
negate the other conditions of this License, if applicable to the Patch.<br>
.<br>
7. Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing<br>
.<br>
If I offer to license, for a fee, a Covered Work under terms other than<br>
a license that is OSI-Approved or FSF-Free as of the release date of this<br>
License or a numbered version of copyleft-next released by the<br>
Copyleft-Next Project, then the license I grant You under section 1 is no<br>
longer subject to the conditions in sections 2 through 5.<br>
.<br>
8. Copyleft Sunset<br>
.<br>
The conditions in sections 2 through 5 no longer apply once fifteen<br>
years have elapsed from the date of My first Distribution of My Work<br>
under this License.<br>
.<br>
9. Pass-Through<br>
.<br>
When You Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives<br>
a license to My Work from Me, subject to the terms of this License.<br>
.<br>
10. Termination<br>
.<br>
Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if You<br>
.<br>
a) fail to comply with the conditions of this License, unless You cure<br>
such noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or<br>
.<br>
b) initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding<br>
declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims)<br>
alleging that any part of My Work directly or indirectly infringes<br>
any patent.<br>
.<br>
Termination of Your license grants extends to all copies of Covered<br>
Works You subsequently obtain. Termination does not terminate the<br>
rights of those who have received copies or rights from You subject to<br>
this License.<br>
.<br>
To the extent permission to make copies of a Covered Work is necessary<br>
merely for running it, such permission is not terminable.<br>
.<br>
11. Later License Versions<br>
.<br>
The Copyleft-Next Project may release new versions of copyleft-next,<br>
designated by a distinguishing version number ("Later Versions").<br>
Unless I explicitly remove the option of Distributing Covered Works<br>
under Later Versions, You may Distribute Covered Works under any Later<br>
Version.<br>
.<br>

**     To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any   **<br>
**     Distributor of My Work be liable to You for any damages           **<br>
**     whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, or     **<br>
**     consequential damages, whether arising under contract, tort       **<br>
**     (including negligence), or otherwise, even where the Distributor  **<br>
**     knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages.  **<br>
