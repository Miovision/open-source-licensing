SMAIL GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
(Clarified 11 Feb 1988)<br>
<br>
Copyright (C)  1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr<br>
Copyright (C)  1992 Ronald S. Karr<br>
Copyleft (GNU) 1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also<br>
use this wording to make the terms for other programs.<br>
<br>
The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the<br>
mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is<br>
intended to give everyone the right to share SMAIL.  To make sure that<br>
you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions<br>
that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender<br>
the rights.  Hence this license agreement.<br>
<br>
Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give<br>
away copies of SMAIL, that you receive source code or else can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change SMAIL or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to<br>
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute<br>
copies of SMAIL, you must give the recipients all the rights that you<br>
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.<br>
<br>
Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone<br>
finds out that there is no warranty for SMAIL.  If SMAIL is modified by<br>
someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what<br>
they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems introduced<br>
by others will not reflect on our reputation.<br>
<br>
Therefore we (Landon Curt Noll and Ronald S. Karr) make the following<br>
terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change<br>
SMAIL.<br>
<br>
<br>
COPYING POLICIES<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of SMAIL source code<br>
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice "Copyright<br>
(C) 1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr" (or with whatever year is<br>
appropriate); keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this<br>
License Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any<br>
other recipients of the SMAIL program a copy of this License<br>
Agreement along with the program.  You may charge a distribution fee<br>
for the physical act of transferring a copy.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of SMAIL or any portion of it,<br>
and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of<br>
Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:<br>
<br>
a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating<br>
that you changed the files and the date of any change; and<br>
<br>
b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,<br>
that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of SMAIL or<br>
any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third<br>
parties on terms identical to those contained in this License<br>
Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive<br>
warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).<br>
<br>
c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of<br>
transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty<br>
protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
Mere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or its<br>
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring<br>
the other program under the scope of these terms.<br>
<br>
3. You may copy and distribute SMAIL (or a portion or derivative of it,<br>
under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of<br>
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,<br>
<br>
b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal<br>
shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the<br>
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of<br>
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,<br>
<br>
c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the<br>
corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is<br>
allowed only for non-commercial distribution and only if you<br>
received the program in object code or executable form alone.)<br>
<br>
For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for<br>
all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include<br>
source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the<br>
operating system on which the executable file runs.<br>
<br>
4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL<br>
except as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL is void and<br>
your rights to use the program under this License agreement shall be<br>
automatically terminated.  However, parties who have received computer<br>
software programs from you with this License Agreement will not have<br>
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
5. If you wish to incorporate parts of SMAIL into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to Landon<br>
Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr via the Free Software Foundation at 51<br>
Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.  We have not yet<br>
worked out a simple rule that can be stated here, but we will often<br>
permit this.  We will be guided by the two goals of preserving the<br>
free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting<br>
the sharing and reuse of software.<br>
<br>
Your comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our<br>
software are welcome!  This contract was based on the contract made by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  Please contact the Free Software<br>
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301,<br>
USA, or call (617) 542-5942 for details on copylefted material in<br>
general.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
BECAUSE SMAIL IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY NO<br>
WARRANTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE STATE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, LANDON CURT NOLL & RONALD S. KARR AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE SMAIL "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,<br>
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED<br>
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br>
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF SMAIL IS WITH<br>
YOU.  SHOULD SMAIL PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL<br>
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL LANDON CURT NOLL &<br>
RONALD S. KARR AND/OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE<br>
SMAIL AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
LOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE<br>
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED<br>
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE<br>
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS) SMAIL, EVEN IF YOU HAVE<br>
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY<br>
ANY OTHER PARTY.<br>
