THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS<br>
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS<br>
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE<br>
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS<br>
PROHIBITED.<br>
<br>
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND<br>
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS<br>
LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU<br>
THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF<br>
SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.<br>
<br>
1. Definitions<br>
<br>
a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work<br>
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,<br>
derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a<br>
literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes<br>
cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may<br>
be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form<br>
recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that<br>
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for<br>
the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the<br>
Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the<br>
synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image<br>
("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,<br>
such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms<br>
or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works<br>
listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and<br>
arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations,<br>
in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form<br>
along with one or more other contributions, each constituting<br>
separate and independent works in themselves, which together are<br>
assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a<br>
Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below)<br>
for the purposes of this License.<br>
<br>
c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is<br>
listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has<br>
been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent<br>
to this License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i)<br>
contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as<br>
the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits<br>
the relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that<br>
license under this License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction<br>
license with the same License Elements as this License.<br>
<br>
d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original<br>
and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale<br>
or other transfer of ownership.<br>
<br>
e. "License Elements" means the following high-level license<br>
attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of<br>
this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.<br>
<br>
f. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities<br>
that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.<br>

g. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic<br>
work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created<br>
the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the<br>
publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the<br>
actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act,<br>
sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform<br>
literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the<br>
case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity<br>
who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,<br>
(iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits<br>
the broadcast.<br>
<br>
h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the<br>
terms of this License including without limitation any production<br>
in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be<br>
the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as<br>
a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or<br>
other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical<br>
work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical<br>
composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which<br>
are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to<br>
cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,<br>
sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which<br>
are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to<br>
photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,<br>
sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,<br>
architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a<br>
compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a<br>
copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus<br>
performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary<br>
or artistic work.<br>
<br>
i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this<br>
License who has not previously violated the terms of this License<br>
with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission<br>
from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a<br>
previous violation.<br>
<br>
j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the<br>
Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by<br>
any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public<br>
digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such<br>
a way that members of the public may access these Works from a<br>
place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the<br>
Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to<br>
the public of the performances of the Work, including by public<br>
digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any<br>
means including signs, sounds or images.<br>
<br>
k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means<br>
including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the<br>
right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including<br>
storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or<br>
other electronic medium.<br>
<br>
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to<br>
reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights<br>
arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in<br>
connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or<br>
other applicable laws.<br>
<br>
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this<br>
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,<br>
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable<br>
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated<br>
below:<br>
<br>
a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more<br>
Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the<br>
Collections;<br>
<br>
b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such<br>
Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes<br>
reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify<br>
that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a<br>
translation could be marked "The original work was translated from<br>
English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original<br>
work has been modified.";<br>
<br>
c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as<br>
incorporated in Collections; and,<br>
<br>
d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.<br>
<br>
e. For the avoidance of doubt:<br>
<br>
i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions<br>
in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br>
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor<br>
reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any<br>
exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;<br>
<br>
ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br>
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br>
compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the<br>
exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You<br>
of the rights granted under this License; and,<br>
<br>
iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to<br>
collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the<br>
Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers<br>
voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise<br>
by You of the rights granted under this License.<br>
<br>
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether<br>
now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right<br>
to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise<br>
the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all<br>
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.<br>
<br>
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly<br>
made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:<br>
<br>
a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the<br>
terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform<br>
Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the<br>
Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or<br>
impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this<br>
License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the<br>
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.<br>
You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices<br>
that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with<br>
every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You<br>
Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any<br>
effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the<br>
ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights<br>
granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This<br>
Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection,<br>
but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself<br>
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a<br>
Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent<br>
practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by<br>
Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon<br>
notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,<br>
remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c),<br>
as requested.<br>
<br>
b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under<br>
the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this<br>
License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a<br>
Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later<br>
license version) that contains the same License Elements as this<br>
License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative<br>
Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one<br>
of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms<br>
of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of<br>
any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the<br>
"Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of the<br>
Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You<br>
must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with<br>
every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform;<br>
(II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that<br>
restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the<br>
recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that<br>
recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must<br>
keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to<br>
the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as<br>
included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV)<br>
when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not<br>
impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that<br>
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to<br>
exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of<br>
the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation<br>
as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the<br>
Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to<br>
the terms of the Applicable License.<br>
<br>
c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any<br>
Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been<br>
made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices<br>
for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are<br>
utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if<br>
applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or<br>
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor<br>
institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution<br>
("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of<br>
service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or<br>
parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the<br>
extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor<br>
specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not<br>
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the<br>
Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an<br>
Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the<br>
Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original<br>
Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original<br>
Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be<br>
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in<br>
the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit<br>
will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the<br>
Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and<br>
in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other<br>
contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use<br>
the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution<br>
in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under<br>
this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply<br>
any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original<br>
Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You<br>
or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior<br>
written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or<br>
Attribution Parties.<br>
<br>
d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may<br>
be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,<br>
Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part<br>
of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate,<br>
modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work<br>
which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or<br>
reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g.<br>
Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b)<br>
of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to<br>
be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory<br>
action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation,<br>
the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this<br>
Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national<br>
law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section<br>
3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.<br>
<br>
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer<br>
<br>
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,<br>
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR<br>
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,<br>
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF<br>
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,<br>
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,<br>
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT<br>
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY<br>
LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR<br>
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE<br>
WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
7. Termination<br>
<br>
a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.<br>
Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or<br>
Collections from You under this License, however, will not have<br>
their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities<br>
remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,<br>
7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.<br>
<br>
b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted<br>
here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in<br>
the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right<br>
to release the Work under different license terms or to stop<br>
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such<br>
election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other<br>
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the<br>
terms of this License), and this License will continue in full<br>
force and effect unless terminated as stated above.<br>
<br>
8. Miscellaneous<br>
<br>
a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a<br>
Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the<br>
Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You<br>
under this License.<br>
<br>
b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,<br>
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on<br>
the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable<br>
under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or<br>
enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and<br>
without further action by the parties to this agreement, such<br>
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make<br>
such provision valid and enforceable.<br>
<br>
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and<br>
no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in<br>
writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or<br>
consent.<br>
<br>
e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the<br>
parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no<br>
understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the<br>
Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any<br>
additional provisions that may appear in any communication from<br>
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written<br>
agreement of the Licensor and You.<br>
<br>
f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in<br>
this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne<br>
Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as<br>
amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the<br>
WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms<br>
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised<br>
on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in<br>
the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to<br>
be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the<br>
implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable<br>
national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under<br>
applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted<br>
under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be<br>
included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict<br>
the license of any rights under applicable law.<br>
