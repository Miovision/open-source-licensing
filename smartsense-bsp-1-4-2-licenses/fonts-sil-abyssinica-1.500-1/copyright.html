SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
.<br>
PREAMBLE<br>
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br>
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br>
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br>
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br>
with others.<br>
.<br>
The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br>
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br>
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,<br>
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br>
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br>
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br>
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br>
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<br>
.<br>
