SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
.<br>
PREAMBLE<br>
.<br>
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development<br>
of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic<br>
and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which<br>
fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.<br>
.<br>
The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed<br>
freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any<br>
derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any<br>
software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The<br>
fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license.<br>
The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any<br>
document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<br>
.<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>

statement(s).<br>
.<br>

distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).<br>
.<br>
"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or<br>

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall<br>

their explicit written permission.<br>

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed<br>
