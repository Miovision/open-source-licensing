.<br>
Statement of Purpose<br>
.<br>
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer<br>
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and<br>
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of<br>
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work"). Certain owners wish to<br>
permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing<br>
to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the<br>
public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build<br>
upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as<br>
possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without<br>
limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to<br>
promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative,<br>
cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution<br>
for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others. For these and/or<br>
other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional<br>
consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the<br>
"Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related<br>
Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly<br>
distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and<br>
Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on<br>
those rights.<br>
.<br>
1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be<br>
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and<br>
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to,<br>
the following:<br>
i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,<br>
and translate a Work;<br>
ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);<br>
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness<br>
depicted in a Work;<br>
iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject<br>
to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;<br>
v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a<br>
Work;<br>
vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the<br>
European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection<br>
of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any<br>
amended or successor version of such directive); and<br>
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world<br>
based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.<br>
.<br>
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,<br>
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and<br>
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright<br>
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now<br>
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of<br>
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum<br>
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time<br>
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of<br>
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation<br>
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver").<br>
Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large<br>
and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that<br>
such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,<br>
termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet<br>
enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express<br>
Statement of Purpose.<br>
.<br>
3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be<br>
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver<br>
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account<br>
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver<br>
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non<br>
transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional<br>
license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in<br>
all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by<br>
applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any<br>
current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any<br>
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or<br>
promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective<br>
as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of<br>
the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under<br>
applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not<br>
invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby<br>
affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining<br>
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims<br>
and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to<br>
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.<br>
.<br>
4. Limitations and Disclaimers.<br>
a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,<br>
surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.<br>
b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of<br>
any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,<br>
including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for<br>
a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other<br>
defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not<br>
discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.<br>
c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that<br>
may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any<br>
person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims<br>
responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other<br>
rights required for any use of the Work.<br>
d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party<br>
to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use<br>
of the Work.<br>
