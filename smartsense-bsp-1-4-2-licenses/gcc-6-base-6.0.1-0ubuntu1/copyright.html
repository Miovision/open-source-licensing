This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler<br>
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, Fortran 95, Java, Objective-C,<br>
Objective-C++, and Treelang compilers, documentation, and support<br>
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gdc compiler, either in<br>
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.<br>
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers<br>
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:<br>
<br>
ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)<br>
svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)<br>
http://bitbucket.org/goshawk/gdc     (for D)<br>
<br>
The current gcc-6 source package is taken from the SVN gcc-6-branch.<br>
<br>
Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz<br>
<br>
Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,<br>
library, and documentation as follows:<br>
<br>
Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Ada            gnat-6          libgnat-6        gnat-6-doc<br>
C              gcc-6                              gcc-6-doc<br>
C++            g++-6           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-6-doc<br>
D              gdc-6<br>
Fortran 95     gfortran-6      libgfortran3       gfortran-6-doc<br>
Go             gccgo-6         libgo0<br>
Java           gcj-6           libgcj10           libgcj-doc<br>
Objective C    gobjc-6         libobjc2<br>
Objective C++  gobjc++-6<br>
<br>
For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,<br>
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-<br>
independent code in separate packages:<br>
<br>
Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
C++                                  libstdc++6-6-dbg  libstdc++6-6-pic<br>
D         libphobos-6-dev<br>
Java      libgcj10-src libgcj10-dev  libgcj10-dbg<br>
<br>

<br>
Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,<br>
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some<br>
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of<br>
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which<br>
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names<br>
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit<br>
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all<br>
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64<br>
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.<br>

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION<br>
<br>
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this<br>
license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional<br>
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version<br>
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that<br>
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that<br>
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.<br>
<br>
When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of<br>
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled<br>
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of<br>
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the<br>
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.<br>
<br>
0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime<br>
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an<br>
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based<br>
on the Runtime Library.<br>
<br>
"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without<br>
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of<br>
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any<br>
subsequent versions published by the FSF.<br>
<br>
"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,<br>
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with<br>
the license of GCC.<br>
<br>
"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual<br>
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for<br>
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution<br>
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any<br>
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used<br>
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.<br>
<br>
The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in<br>
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in<br>
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,<br>
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered<br>
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be<br>
understood as starting with the output of the generators or<br>
preprocessors.<br>
<br>
A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or<br>
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any<br>
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to<br>
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an<br>
Eligible Compilation Process.<br>
<br>
1. Grant of Additional Permission.<br>
<br>
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by<br>
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such<br>
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that<br>
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You<br>
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,<br>
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.<br>
<br>
2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.<br>
<br>
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general<br>
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft<br>
requirements of the license of GCC.<br>
