GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION<br>
.<br>
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009<br>
.<br>
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
.<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this<br>
license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
.<br>
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional<br>
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version<br>
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that<br>
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that<br>
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.<br>
.<br>
When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of<br>
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled<br>
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of<br>
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the<br>
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.<br>
.<br>
0. Definitions.<br>
.<br>
A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime<br>
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an<br>
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based<br>
on the Runtime Library.<br>
.<br>
"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without<br>
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of<br>
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any<br>
subsequent versions published by the FSF.<br>
.<br>
"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,<br>
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with<br>
the license of GCC.<br>
.<br>
"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual<br>
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for<br>
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution<br>
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any<br>
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used<br>
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.<br>
.<br>
The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in<br>
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in<br>
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,<br>
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered<br>
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be<br>
understood as starting with the output of the generators or<br>
preprocessors.<br>
.<br>
A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or<br>
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any<br>
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to<br>
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an<br>
Eligible Compilation Process.<br>
.<br>
1. Grant of Additional Permission.<br>
.<br>
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by<br>
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such<br>
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that<br>
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You<br>
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,<br>
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.<br>
.<br>
2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.<br>
.<br>
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general<br>
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft<br>
requirements of the license of GCC.<br>
