This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU groff<br>
document formatting system.<br>
GNU groff was written by James Clark <jjc@jclark.com>.<br>
It is now maintained by Ted Harding <ted.harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk> and<br>
Werner Lemberg <wl@gnu.org>.<br>
<br>
This Debian package was previously maintained by Fabrizio Polacco<br>
<fpolacco@debian.org>.<br>
It is now maintained by Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>.<br>
<br>
The original tarball came from <URL:ftp://groff.ffii.org/pub/groff/>:<br>
48fa768dd6fdeb7968041dd5ae8e2b02  groff-1.20.1.tar.gz<br>
and was simply renamed to groff_1.20.1.orig.tar.gz.<br>
<br>
Some patches have been applied to groff outside the debian directory.<br>
<br>
The Debian diff also appends /usr/share/groff/tmac to the default macro path<br>
for compatibility with versions of groff earlier than 1.17 (patch by Colin<br>
Watson).<br>

The groff manual is also distributed under the terms of the GNU Free<br>
Documentation License version 1.3.  On Debian systems, this is available in<br>
/usr/share/common-licenses/GFDL-1.3 as part of the base-files package.<br>
However, Debian does not consider this free when the Front-Cover Texts or<br>
Back-Cover Texts options are used.  groff is distributed with a LICENSES<br>
file containing the following text (excerpted):<br>
<br>
The groff program is a free software project.  It is licensed under the GNU<br>
General Public License (GNU GPL), version 3 or later.<br>
<br>
The file COPYING in the top directory of the groff source package contains a<br>
copy of the GPL that was downloaded from the GNU web site<br>
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.txt at 3 jan 2009.<br>
<br>
All files part of groff are licensed under this version of the GPL (or<br>
licenses which are compatible with the GPL). You are free to choose<br>
version 3 or any subsequent version of the GPL.<br>
<br>
I e-mailed the upstream maintainer to clarify the intent of this. Here is<br>
the relevant part of the reply:<br>

<br>
This is the intention, of course.<br>

<br>
Sigh.  I haven't found time to revert the FDL stuff back to GPL.  It<br>
basically affects only Bernd Warken and me, and we have both agreed to<br>
return to GPL in case FDL makes problems.<br>
<br>
(Note that this e-mail predates the current wording in LICENSES.)<br>
<br>
It is therefore my understanding that the copyright holders of the groff<br>
documentation intend it to be distributable under the terms of the GPL<br>
version 3 or later.  The reference above to the FDL text in<br>
/usr/share/common-licenses/ is for information only.<br>

ftp://labrea.stanford.edu/pub/tex/dist/lib/hyphen.tex<br>
<br>
It has been renamed for consistency, i.e., to make patterns available under<br>
the filenames hyphen.<language>, e.g. hyphen.de or hyphen.uk.<br>

Unlimited copying and redistribution of this file are permitted as long<br>
as this file is not modified. Modifications are permitted, but only if<br>
the resulting file is not named hyphen.tex.<br>
