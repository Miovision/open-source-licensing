This dictionary is based on a subset of the original<br>
English wordlist created by Kevin Atkinson for Pspell<br>

LGPL license.  The affix file is a heavily modified<br>
version of the original english.aff file which was<br>
released as part of Geoff Kuenning's Ispell and as<br>
such is covered by his BSD license.<br>
