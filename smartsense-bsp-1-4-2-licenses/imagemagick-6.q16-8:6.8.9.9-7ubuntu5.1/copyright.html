.<br>
From 1987 to October 1999 (through ImageMagick 4.2.9), ImageMagick<br>
was developed and distributed by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and<br>
Company.<br>
.<br>
As of 1999, E. I. du Pont de Nemours gave up all rights and<br>
privileges to the ImageMagick software suite and assigned<br>
ownership to ImageMagick Studio LLC.<br>
.<br>
ImageMagick makes use of third-party "delegate" libraries to support<br>
certain optional features.  These libraries bear their own copyrights<br>
and licenses, which may be more or less restrictive than the<br>
ImageMagick license. For convenience, when ImageMagick is bundled<br>
with (or compiled with) "delegate" libraries, a copy of the licenses<br>
for these libraries is provided in a "licenses" directory.<br>

============<br>
.<br>
In plain English:<br>
.<br>
1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,<br>
please let us know!)<br>
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.<br>
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a<br>
program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that<br>
you've used the IJG code.<br>
.<br>
In legalese:<br>
.<br>
The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,<br>
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or<br>
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,<br>
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.<br>
.<br>
This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.<br>
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.<br>
.<br>
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this<br>
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these<br>
conditions:<br>
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this<br>
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice<br>
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files<br>
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.<br>
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying<br>
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of<br>
the Independent JPEG Group".<br>
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts<br>
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept<br>
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.<br>
.<br>
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,<br>
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to<br>
acknowledge us.<br>
.<br>
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name<br>
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from<br>
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's<br>
software".<br>
.<br>
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of<br>
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are<br>
assumed by the product vendor.<br>
.<br>
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,<br>
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.<br>
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead<br>
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,<br>
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file<br>
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part<br>
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than<br>
the foregoing paragraphs do.<br>
.<br>
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.<br>
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.<br>
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,<br>
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright<br>
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.<br>
.<br>
It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by<br>
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot<br>
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,<br>
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.<br>
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented<br>
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)<br>
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining<br>
code.<br>
.<br>
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.<br>
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has<br>
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce<br>
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the<br>
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard<br>
GIF decoders.<br>
.<br>
We are required to state that<br>
"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of<br>
CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of<br>
CompuServe Incorporated."<br>

Derivative Works shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other<br>
modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of<br>
authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall<br>
not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind<br>
by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>

You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution<br>
notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices<br>
that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and<br>
* If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>

the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as<br>
part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of<br>
the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not<br>
modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices<br>
within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an<br>
addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such<br>
additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying<br>
the License.<br>
.<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your<br>
modifications and may provide additional or different license<br>
terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of<br>
Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,<br>
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work<br>
otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.<br>
.<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by<br>
You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this<br>
License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding<br>
the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any<br>
separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor<br>
regarding such Contributions.<br>
.<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
.<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed<br>
to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor<br>
provides its Contributions) on an AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR<br>
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without<br>
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,<br>
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely<br>
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or<br>
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your<br>
exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
.<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless<br>
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent<br>
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You<br>
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or<br>
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this<br>
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but<br>
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer<br>
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or<br>
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility<br>
of such damages.<br>
.<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and<br>
charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other<br>
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on<br>
Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any<br>
other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and<br>
hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or<br>
claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting<br>
any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
.<br>
How to Apply the License to your Work<br>
.<br>
To apply the ImageMagick License to your work, attach the following<br>
boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced<br>
with your own identifying information (don't include the<br>
