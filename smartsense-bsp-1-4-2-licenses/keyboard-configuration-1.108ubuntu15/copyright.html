This copyright file applies both to the source package console-setup<br>
and the binary Debian packages built from it.<br>
<br>
In short, if you use console-setup with precompiled keyboard files,<br>
then all installed files are covered by simple permissive non-copyleft<br>
free software licenses.  However, several of the tools used for the<br>
compilation of the package (in particular 'ckbcomp' and 'bdf2psf') are<br>
covered by GPL, version 2 or later.  The Perl program 'ckbcomp' is<br>
installed in the system when console-setup is not used with<br>
precompiled keyboard files.<br>
<br>
The exact copyright terms follow.<br>
<br>
All console fonts are public domain by nature.<br>
<br>
The source BDF-fonts in the directory Fonts/bdf are distributed under<br>
many different licenses, see in the file copyright.fonts for details.<br>
<br>
The program 'bdf2psf' used to convert the fonts from BDF format to the<br>
format used on the consoles of Linux and FreeBSD is covered by GPL,<br>
version 2 or later.<br>
<br>
The keyboard files are borrowed from the XKeyboardConfig package.  For<br>
the licenses of the keyboard files, see the file copyright.xkb.  The<br>
XKeyboardConfig package was downloaded from<br>
<br>
http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/xkbdesc/xkeyboard-config-0.8.tar.gz<br>
<br>
Please notice, that Debian packages do not include the XKB files (they<br>
are provided by a separate package xkb-data).  When, however, the<br>
Debian package console-setup-mini is installed, it includes<br>
precompiled version of the keyboard files, so the terms in the file<br>
/usr/share/doc/keyboard-configuration/copyright.xkb.gz apply.<br>
