For the ATM-related kernel code, authorship is typically recorded at<br>
the beginning of files. Note that some parts contain code from many<br>
authors, of which only the principal one(s) is or are listed. Kernel<br>
code is released under the conditions described in the file COPYING<br>
in the top-level directory of the kernel (i.e. the GPL, version 2).<br>
<br>
The libraries libatm, libatmd, libarequipa (in src/lib/), libsaal (in<br>
src/saal/), and qlib (in src/qgen/) are covered by the more permissive<br>
Library General Public License. See the file COPYING.LGPL for details.<br>
<br>
Code generated by qgen is only constrained by whatever usage<br>
restrictions apply to the message structure definition used as input,<br>
i.e. the use of qgen for translation does not create any restrictions.<br>
