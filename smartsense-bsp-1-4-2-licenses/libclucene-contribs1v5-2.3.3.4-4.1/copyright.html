<br>
The CLucene Core Library uses a dual license strategy for the source code.<br>
These licenses are the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the Apache<br>
License (Version 2.0). Users can choose the license they wish to distribute<br>
their software under. This means that you do not need to abide by *both*<br>
licenses, but rather than you can choose the license which most suits your<br>
needs.<br>
<br>
To rephrase this and to make it perfectly clear:<br>
CLucene is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)<br>
*or*<br>
the Apache License, Version 2.0<br>
<br>
However, we are an open source project, and we encourage users to use the LGPL<br>
license and participate fully in the free software community. Dual licensing<br>
of the CLucene source code provides open and free access to the technology both<br>
for the GPL community and for other developers or companies that cannot use theGPL.<br>
<br>
You can freely modify, extend, and improve the CLucene source code. The only<br>
question is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute<br>
modifications to the community. The GNU and Apache licenses allow different<br>
ranges of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the<br>
licenseused, we highly recommend that you submit any bugs, incompatibilities or<br>
added features.<br>
<br>
Note that this same license does *not* apply to the CLucene Contributions<br>
package. You should read the COPYING file in that directory or package for<br>
more information.<br>
<br>
CLUCENE SUBCOMPONENTS:<br>
<br>
CLucene includes a number of subcomponents with separate copyright<br>
notices and license terms. Your use of the source code for the<br>
these subcomponents is subject to the terms and conditions of the<br>
following licenses.<br>
<br>
