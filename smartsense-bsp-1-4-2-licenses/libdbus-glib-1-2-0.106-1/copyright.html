The Academic Free License<br>
v. 2.1<br>
.<br>
This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original<br>
work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor")<br>
has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright<br>
notice for the Original Work:<br>
.<br>
Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1<br>
.<br>
1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a<br>
world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable<br>
license to do the following:<br>
.<br>
a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;<br>
.<br>
b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the<br>
Original Work;<br>
.<br>
c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to<br>
the public;<br>
.<br>
d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and<br>
.<br>
e) to display the Original Work publicly.<br>
.<br>
2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,<br>
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under<br>
patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in<br>
the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and<br>
offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.<br>
.<br>
3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the<br>
preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and<br>
all available documentation describing how to modify the Original<br>
Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the<br>
Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original<br>
Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy<br>
this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code<br>
in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit<br>
inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor<br>
continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the<br>
address of that information repository in a notice immediately<br>
following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.<br>
.<br>
4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor<br>
the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their<br>
trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote<br>
products derived from this Original Work without express prior written<br>
permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to<br>
grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or<br>
any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated<br>
herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to<br>
sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims<br>
defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of<br>
Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing<br>
in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from<br>
licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work<br>
that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.<br>
.<br>
5) This section intentionally omitted.<br>
.<br>
6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any<br>
Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark<br>
notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any<br>
notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an<br>
"Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any<br>
Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution<br>
Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have<br>
modified the Original Work.<br>
.<br>
7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor<br>
warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent<br>
rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are<br>
sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission<br>
of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as<br>
expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original<br>
Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT<br>
WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,<br>
the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A<br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL<br>
WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential<br>
part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder<br>
except under this disclaimer.<br>
.<br>
8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal<br>
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or<br>
otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct,<br>
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any<br>
character arising as a result of this License or the use of the<br>
Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of<br>
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and<br>
all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability<br>
shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting<br>
from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such<br>
limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or<br>
limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion<br>
and limitation may not apply to You.<br>
.<br>
9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the<br>
Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort<br>
under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to<br>
the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another<br>
written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to<br>
create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise<br>
any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do<br>
so except under the terms of this License (or another written<br>
agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by<br>
U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by<br>
international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights<br>
granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of<br>
this License and all of its terms and conditions.<br>
.<br>
10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate<br>
automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted<br>
to You by this License as of the date You commence an action,<br>
including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any<br>
licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This<br>
termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent<br>
infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software<br>
or hardware.<br>
.<br>
11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating<br>
to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction<br>
wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary<br>
business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its<br>
conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations<br>
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is<br>
expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of<br>
this License or after its termination shall be subject to the<br>
requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101<br>
et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international<br>
treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.<br>
.<br>
12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License<br>
or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be<br>
entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without<br>
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in<br>
connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This<br>
section shall survive the termination of this License.<br>
.<br>
13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement<br>
concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License<br>
is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to<br>
the extent necessary to make it enforceable.<br>
.<br>
14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this<br>
License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a<br>
legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the<br>
terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity<br>
that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with<br>
you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power,<br>
direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such<br>
entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty<br>
percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial<br>
ownership of such entity.<br>
.<br>
15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not<br>
otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and<br>
Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such<br>
uses by You.<br>
