The files doc/djvu{2,3}spec.djvu are documentation for the DjVu<br>
format.  The original LaTeX sources for these documents has been lost.<br>
It would be great if someone were to recreate it, rendering the<br>
documents more tractibly modified and reformatted.<br>
<br>
The files doc/lizard200{2,7}.{djvu,pdf} are legal documents related<br>
to the freedom of this package itself, and hence need not themselves<br>
be covered by a free license.<br>
