* This is the header file for the MD5 message-digest algorithm.<br>
* The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was<br>
* written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.<br>
* This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.<br>
*<br>
* Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.<br>
* This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,<br>
* except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese<br>
* with every copy.<br>
*<br>
* To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an<br>
* MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as<br>
* needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which<br>
* will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.<br>
*<br>
* Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h'<br>
* header definitions; now uses stuff from dpkg's config.h<br>
*  - Ian Jackson <ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu>.<br>
* Still in the public domain.<br>
*<br>
* Josh Coalson: made some changes to integrate with libFLAC.<br>
* Still in the public domain, with no warranty.<br>
