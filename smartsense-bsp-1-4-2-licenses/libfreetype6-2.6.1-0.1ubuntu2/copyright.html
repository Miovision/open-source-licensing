Introduction<br>
============<br>
.<br>
The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;<br>
some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,<br>
various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the<br>
FreeType Project.<br>
.<br>
This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and<br>
which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license<br>
affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,<br>
documentation and makefiles, at the very least.<br>
.<br>
This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG<br>
(Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion<br>
and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products<br>
alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:<br>
.<br>
o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be<br>
interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)<br>
.<br>
o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or<br>
full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)<br>
.<br>
o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use<br>
it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge<br>
somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the<br>
FreeType code. (`credits')<br>
.<br>
We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this<br>
software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.<br>
We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and<br>
assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
Legal Terms<br>
===========<br>
.<br>
0. Definitions<br>
--------------<br>
.<br>
Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',<br>
and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally<br>
distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and<br>
Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,<br>
beta or final release.<br>
.<br>
`You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where<br>
`using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source<br>
code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.<br>
This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType<br>
engine'.<br>
.<br>
This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original<br>
FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and<br>
documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its<br>
original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.<br>
If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by<br>
this license, you must contact us to verify this.<br>

following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation<br>
or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',<br>
`FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.<br>

As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to<br>
accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted<br>
material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the<br>
authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.<br>
Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType<br>
Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms<br>
of this license.<br>
