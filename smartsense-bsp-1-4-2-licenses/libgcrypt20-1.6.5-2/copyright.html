============<br>
<br>
Libgcrypt used to be part of GnuPG but has been taken out into its own<br>
package on 2000-12-21.<br>
<br>
The ATH implementation (src/ath*) has been taken from GPGME and<br>
relicensed to the LGPL by the copyright holder of GPGME (g10 Code<br>
GmbH); it is now considered to be a part of Libgcrypt.<br>
<br>
Most of the stuff in mpi has been taken from an old GMP library<br>
version by Torbjorn Granlund <tege@noisy.tmg.se>.<br>
<br>
The files cipher/rndunix.c and cipher/rndw32.c are based on those<br>
files from Cryptlib.  Copyright Peter Gutmann, Paul Kendall, and Chris<br>
Wedgwood 1996-1999.<br>
<br>
The ECC code cipher/ecc.c was based on code by Sergi Blanch i Torne,<br>
sergi at calcurco dot org.<br>
<br>
The implementation of the Camellia cipher has been been taken from the<br>
original NTT provided GPL source.<br>
<br>
The CAVS testing program tests/cavs_driver.pl is not to be considered<br>
a part of libgcrypt proper.  We distribute it merely for convenience.<br>
It has a permissive license and is copyrighted by atsec information<br>
security corporation.  See the file for details.<br>
<br>
The file salsa20.c is based on D.J. Bernstein's public domain code and<br>
taken from Nettle.  Copyright 2012 Simon Josefsson and Niels Möller.<br>

License:<br>
<br>
Most of the package is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
License (LGPL) version 2.1 (or later), except for helper and debugging<br>
binaries. See below for details. The documentation is licensed under<br>
the GPLv2 (or later), see below.<br>
<br>
Excerpt from upstream's README:<br>
<br>
The library is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License (LGPL); see the file COPYING.LIB for the<br>
actual terms.  The helper programs (e.g. gcryptrnd and getrandom)<br>
as well as the documentation are distributed under the terms of<br>
the GNU General Public License (GPL); see the file COPYING for the<br>
actual terms.<br>
<br>
This library used to be available under the GPL - this was changed<br>
with version 1.1.7 with the rationale that there are now many free<br>
crypto libraries available and many of them come with capabilities<br>
similar to Libcrypt.  We decided that to foster the use of<br>
cryptography in Free Software an LGPLed library would make more<br>
sense because it avoids problems due to license incompatibilities<br>
between some Free Software licenses and the GPL.<br>
<br>
Please note that in many cases it is better for a library to be<br>
licensed under the GPL, so that it provides an advantage for free<br>
software projects.  The Lesser GPL is so named because it does<br>
less to protect the freedom of the users of the code that it<br>
covers.  See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html for<br>
more explanation.<br>
