Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,<br>
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this<br>
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,<br>
import, transfer, and otherwise run, modify and propagate the<br>

only to those patent claims, both currently owned by Google and<br>
acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily<br>
infringed by this implementation of VP8. This grant does not include<br>
claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further<br>

patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or<br>
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that this implementation of VP8<br>
or any code incorporated within this implementation of VP8<br>
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement<br>
of patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under<br>
this License for this implementation of VP8 shall terminate as of the<br>
date such litigation is filed.<br>
