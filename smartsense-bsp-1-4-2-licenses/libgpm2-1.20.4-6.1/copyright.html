This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of the General Purpose<br>
Mouse Interface utility. The general purpose mouse daemon tries to be<br>
a useful mouse server for applications running on the Linux console.<br>
<br>
This package was put together by, James Troup <james@nocrew.org>.<br>
<br>
Now maintained as a team by:<br>
<br>
Guillem Jover <guillem@debian.org><br>
Peter Samuelson <peter@p12n.org><br>
<br>
The upstream source was downloaded from:<br>
<br>
<http://unix.schottelius.org/gpm/archives/><br>
<br>
The initial changes while packaging were minor :-<br>
<br>
- adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding<br>
various debian/* files.<br>
- gpm.c (processConn): type of socket length changed (size_t -> socklen_t).<br>
- debuglog.c: #include <string.h> to quiet -Wall.<br>
- doc/Makefile.in (maintainer-clean): clean without interaction and<br>
clean all relevant files (i.e. gpm.info-{1,2}).<br>
- doc/Makefile.in: add support for mouse-test.1.<br>
<br>
The following changes were thought of and done mostly by François<br>
Gouget <fgouget@mygale.org>; though I didn't apply his patches as<br>
they were for various reasons:<br>
<br>
- gpn.c (cmdline): modified handling of -t command line argument, so it<br>
can be used by anyone regardless of whether or not a copy of gpm is<br>
already running.<br>
- gpn.c (usage): update for new -t option "types".<br>
- mice.c: improved descriptions of mouse types.<br>
- mice.c (M_listMice): function used by -t help, reworked version of<br>
old M_listTypes.<br>
- mice.c (M_listTypes): function used by -t types; lists only<br>
mnemonics.<br>
