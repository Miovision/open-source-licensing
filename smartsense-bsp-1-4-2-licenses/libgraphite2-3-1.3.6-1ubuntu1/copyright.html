SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
.<br>
PREAMBLE<br>
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br>
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br>
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br>
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br>
with others.<br>
.<br>
The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br>
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br>
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,<br>
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br>
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br>
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br>
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br>
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<br>
.<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright<br>
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may<br>
include source files, build scripts and documentation.<br>
.<br>
"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the<br>
copyright statement(s).<br>
.<br>
"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as<br>
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).<br>
.<br>
"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,<br>
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the<br>
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a<br>
new environment.<br>
.<br>
"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical<br>
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.<br>
.<br>
PERMISSION & CONDITIONS<br>
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br>
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,<br>
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font<br>
Software, subject to the following conditions:<br>
.<br>
1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,<br>
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.<br>
.<br>
2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,<br>
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy<br>
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be<br>
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or<br>
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or<br>
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.<br>
.<br>
3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font<br>
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding<br>
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as<br>
presented to the users.<br>
.<br>
4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font<br>
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any<br>
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the<br>
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written<br>
permission.<br>
.<br>
5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,<br>
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be<br>
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to<br>
remain under this license does not apply to any document created<br>
using the Font Software.<br>
.<br>
TERMINATION<br>
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are<br>
not met.<br>
.<br>
DISCLAIMER<br>
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,<br>
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT<br>
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE<br>
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL<br>
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING<br>
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM<br>
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.<br>
