----------------<br>
<br>
1. Definitions.<br>
<br>
1.1. ``Contributor'' means each entity that creates or contributes to<br>
the creation of Modifications.<br>
<br>
1.2. ``Contributor Version'' means the combination of the Original<br>
Code, prior Modifications used by a Contributor, and the Modifications<br>
made by that particular Contributor.<br>
<br>
1.3. ``Covered Code'' means the Original Code or Modifications or the<br>
combination of the Original Code and Modifications, in each case<br>
including portions thereof.<br>
<br>
1.4. ``Electronic Distribution Mechanism'' means a mechanism generally<br>
accepted in the software development community for the electronic<br>
transfer of data.<br>
<br>
1.5. ``Executable'' means Covered Code in any form other than Source<br>
Code.<br>
<br>
1.6. ``Initial Developer'' means the individual or entity identified as<br>
the Initial Developer in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A.<br>
<br>
1.7. ``Larger Work'' means a work which combines Covered Code or<br>
portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
1.8. ``License'' means this document.<br>
<br>
1.9. ``Modifications'' means any addition to or deletion from the<br>
substance or structure of either the Original Code or any previous<br>
Modifications. When Covered Code is released as a series of files, a<br>
Modification is:<br>
<br>
A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file<br>
containing Original Code or previous Modifications.<br>
<br>
B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or<br>
previous Modifications.<br>
<br>

<br>
1.11. ``Source Code'' means the preferred form of the Covered Code for<br>
making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, scripts used to control<br>
compilation and installation of an Executable, or a list of source code<br>
differential comparisons against either the Original Code or another<br>
well known, available Covered Code of the Contributor's choice. The<br>

appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available<br>
for no charge.<br>
<br>
1.12. ``You'' means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights<br>
under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future<br>
version of this License issued under Section 6.1. For legal entities,<br>
``You'' includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is<br>
under common control with You. For purposes of this definition,<br>

<br>
2. Source Code License.<br>
<br>
2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.<br>
The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<br>
non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property<br>
claims:<br>
<br>
(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and<br>
distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without<br>
Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and<br>
<br>
(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial<br>
Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the<br>
Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that<br>
any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize<br>
the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater<br>
extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or<br>
combinations.<br>
<br>
2.2. Contributor Grant.<br>
Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<br>
non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property<br>
claims:<br>
<br>
(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and<br>
distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or<br>
portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other<br>
Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and<br>
<br>
(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by<br>
Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions<br>
thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is<br>
reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor<br>
Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that<br>
may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.<br>
<br>
3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
<br>
3.1. Application of License.<br>
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are<br>
governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation<br>
Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed<br>
only under the terms of this License or a future version of this<br>
License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this<br>
License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not<br>
offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or<br>
restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'<br>
rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document<br>
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.<br>
<br>
3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br>
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be<br>
made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License<br>
either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted<br>
Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an<br>
Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic<br>
Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)<br>
months after the date it initially became available, or at least six<br>
(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification<br>
has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for<br>
ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the<br>
Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<br>
<br>
3.3. Description of Modifications.<br>
You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a<br>
file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and<br>
the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the<br>
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code<br>
provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial<br>
Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an<br>
Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the<br>
origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br>
<br>
(a) Third Party Claims.<br>
If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property<br>
right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization<br>
under this License), you must include a text file with the source<br>
code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and<br>
the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient<br>
will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You<br>
make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You<br>
shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make<br>
available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying<br>
appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to<br>
inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has<br>
been obtained.<br>
<br>
(b) Contributor APIs.<br>
If Your Modification is an application programming interface and<br>
You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to<br>
implement that API, you must also include this information in the<br>
LEGAL file.<br>
<br>
3.5. Required Notices.<br>
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source<br>
Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where<br>
You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You<br>
created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a<br>
Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible<br>
to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its<br>
structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a<br>
relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such<br>
a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,<br>
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients<br>
of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and<br>
not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must<br>
make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or<br>
liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to<br>
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability<br>
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of<br>
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
<br>
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br>
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,<br>
and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the<br>
Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a<br>
description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of<br>
Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in<br>
an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You<br>
describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may<br>
distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of<br>
Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,<br>
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and<br>
that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit<br>
or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the<br>
rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable<br>
version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear<br>
that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,<br>
not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to<br>
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability<br>
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of<br>
any such terms You offer.<br>
<br>
3.7. Larger Works.<br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code<br>
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<br>
Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the<br>
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br>
<br>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br>
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute<br>
or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License<br>
to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and<br>
the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL<br>
file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all<br>
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by<br>
statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed<br>
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br>
<br>
5. Application of this License.<br>
<br>
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<br>
attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.<br>
<br>
6. Versions of the License.<br>
<br>
6.1. New Versions.<br>
Netscape Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may publish revised<br>
and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will<br>
be given a distinguishing version number.<br>
<br>
6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the<br>
License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that<br>
version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms<br>
of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one<br>
other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to<br>
Covered Code created under this License.<br>
<br>
6.3. Derivative Works.<br>
If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may<br>
only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code<br>
governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the<br>
phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'', ``MOZPL'', ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or<br>
any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license<br>
and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license<br>
contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and<br>
Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,<br>
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall<br>
not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)<br>
<br>
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>
<br>
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS,<br>
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br>
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF<br>
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.<br>
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE<br>
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,<br>
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE<br>
COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER<br>
OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF<br>
ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br>
<br>
8. TERMINATION.<br>
<br>
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br>
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All<br>
sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall<br>
survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their<br>
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<br>
shall survive.<br>
<br>
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
<br>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<br>
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL<br>
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,<br>
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER<br>
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES<br>
OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF<br>
GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND<br>
ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE<br>
BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF<br>
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<br>
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW<br>
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br>
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT<br>
EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>
<br>
The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in<br>
48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer<br>
software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such<br>
terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48<br>
C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),<br>
all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those<br>
rights set forth herein.<br>
<br>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
<br>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject<br>
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br>
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br>
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by<br>
California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,<br>
provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With<br>
respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an<br>
entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of<br>
America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating<br>
to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual<br>
property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration,<br>
with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any<br>
arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara<br>
County, California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any<br>
litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the<br>
jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of<br>
California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with<br>
the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,<br>
court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application<br>
of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International<br>
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which<br>
provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the<br>
drafter shall not apply to this License.<br>
<br>
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br>
<br>
Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with<br>
Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or<br>
indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based<br>
on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the<br>
revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant<br>
factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute<br>
responsibility on an equitable basis.<br>
