Additional Copyrights<br>
=====================<br>
<br>
Some files are copyright by the following additional copyright<br>
holders, though in all cases, the copyright is held jointly with IBM<br>
and is subject ICU license above:<br>
<br>
* Google Inc.<br>
* Yahoo! Inc.<br>
<br>
Some files in source/data/sprep contain data that was programmatically<br>
extracted from RFC 3454, but this programmatic extraction was done as<br>
a one-time activity and is not part of ICU's build process.  The<br>
non-free RFC 3454 document is not part of the sources.  The files<br>
generated from RFC 3454 could be considered derived works, so the RFC<br>
3454 copyright requires the inclusion of the original RFC 3454<br>
copyright notice:<br>

others, and derivative works that comment on or otherwise explain it<br>
or assist in its implementation may be prepared, copied, published<br>
and distributed, in whole or in part, without restriction of any<br>
kind, provided that the above copyright notice and this paragraph are<br>
included on all such copies and derivative works.  However, this<br>
document itself may not be modified in any way, such as by removing<br>
the copyright notice or references to the Internet Society or other<br>

copyrights defined in the Internet Standards process must be<br>
followed, or as required to translate it into languages other than<br>
English.<br>
