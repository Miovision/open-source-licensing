License:<br>
This version was made by modifying the master file made by<br>
Oren Patashnik (PATASHNIK@SCORE.STANFORD.EDU), and the 'named' BibTeX<br>
style of Peter F. Patel-Schneider.<br>
.<br>
Copying of this file is authorized only if either<br>
(1) you make absolutely no changes to your copy, including name, or<br>
(2) if you do make changes, you name it something other than 'newapa.bst'.<br>
There are undoubtably bugs in this style.<br>
.<br>
This style was made from 'plain.bst', 'named.bst', and 'apalike.bst',<br>
with lots of tweaking to make it look like APA style, along with tips<br>
from Young Ryu and Brian Reiser's modifications of 'apalike.bst'.<br>
