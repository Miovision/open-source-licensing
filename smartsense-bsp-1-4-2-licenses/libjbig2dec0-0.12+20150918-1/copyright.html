GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
Version 3, 19 November 2007<br>
.<br>
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this<br>
license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
.<br>
Preamble<br>
.<br>
The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure<br>
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.<br>
.<br>
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains<br>
free software for all its users.<br>
.<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.<br>
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the<br>
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if<br>
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,<br>
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free<br>
programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
.<br>
Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights<br>
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you<br>
this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute<br>
and/or modify the software.<br>
.<br>
A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that<br>
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive<br>
widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate.<br>
Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the<br>
resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of software used on<br>
network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General<br>
Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public<br>
access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the<br>
public.<br>
.<br>
The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to<br>
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available<br>
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to<br>
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the<br>
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on<br>
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source<br>
code of the modified version.<br>
.<br>
An older license, called the Affero General Public License and<br>
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is<br>
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has<br>
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing<br>
under this license.<br>
.<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
.<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
.<br>
0. Definitions.<br>
.<br>
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public<br>
License.<br>
.<br>
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
.<br>
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
.<br>
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of<br>
an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of<br>
the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
.<br>
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on<br>
the Program.<br>
.<br>
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
.<br>
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user<br>
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not<br>
conveying.<br>
.<br>
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to<br>
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the<br>
interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu,<br>
a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
.<br>
1. Source Code.<br>
.<br>
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form of<br>
a work.<br>
.<br>
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is<br>
widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
.<br>
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major<br>
Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel,<br>
window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on<br>
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work,<br>
or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
.<br>
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the<br>
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)<br>
run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
.<br>
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can<br>
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.<br>
.<br>
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same<br>
work.<br>
.<br>
2. Basic Permissions.<br>
.<br>
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
.<br>
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,<br>
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.<br>
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having<br>
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with<br>
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the<br>
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not<br>
control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for<br>
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and<br>
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your<br>
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
.<br>
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the<br>
conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes<br>
it unnecessary.<br>
.<br>
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
.<br>
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar<br>
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.<br>
.<br>
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such<br>
circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with<br>
respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit<br>
operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against<br>
the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures.<br>
.<br>
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
.<br>
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
.<br>
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and<br>
you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
.<br>
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
.<br>
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms<br>
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
.<br>
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,<br>
and giving a relevant date.<br>
.<br>
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released<br>
under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This<br>
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all<br>
notices".<br>
.<br>
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to<br>
anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will<br>
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,<br>
to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are<br>
packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in any<br>
other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have<br>
separately received it.<br>
.<br>
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work<br>
need not make them do so.<br>
.<br>
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in<br>
or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used<br>
to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond<br>
what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an<br>
aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of<br>
the aggregate.<br>
.<br>
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
.<br>
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of<br>
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable<br>
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these<br>
ways:<br>
.<br>
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily<br>
used for software interchange.<br>
.<br>
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written<br>
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you<br>
offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give<br>
anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the<br>
Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is<br>
covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used<br>
for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost<br>
of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to<br>
copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
.<br>
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is<br>
allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received<br>
the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.<br>
.<br>
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place<br>
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy<br>
the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on<br>
a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports<br>
equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions<br>
next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.<br>
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain<br>
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to<br>
satisfy these requirements.<br>
.<br>
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you<br>
inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of<br>
the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under<br>
subsection 6d.<br>
.<br>
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included<br>
in conveying the object code work.<br>
.<br>
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for<br>
incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a<br>
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of<br>
coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,<br>
"normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of<br>
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way<br>
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected<br>
to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of<br>
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or<br>
non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode<br>
of use of the product.<br>
.<br>
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to<br>
install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User<br>
Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The<br>
information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of<br>
the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with<br>
solely because modification has been made.<br>
.<br>
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by<br>
the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if<br>
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified<br>
object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been<br>
installed in ROM).<br>
.<br>
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or<br>
updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the<br>
recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or<br>
installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification<br>
itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or<br>
violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.<br>
.<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
.<br>
7. Additional Terms.<br>
.<br>
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
.<br>
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove<br>
any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.<br>
(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in<br>
certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional<br>
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you<br>
have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
.<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders<br>
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
.<br>
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
.<br>
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
.<br>
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
.<br>
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
authors of the material; or<br>
.<br>
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade<br>
names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
.<br>
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material<br>
by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with<br>
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any<br>
liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those<br>
licensors and authors.<br>
.<br>
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
.<br>
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional<br>
terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find<br>
the applicable terms.<br>
.<br>
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the<br>
above requirements apply either way.<br>
.<br>
8. Termination.<br>
.<br>
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
.<br>
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license<br>
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,<br>
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates<br>
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to<br>
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days<br>
after the cessation.<br>
.<br>
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated<br>
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by<br>
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice<br>
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,<br>
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the<br>
notice.<br>
.<br>
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
.<br>
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
.<br>
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run<br>
a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to<br>
receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing<br>
other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify<br>
any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not<br>
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered<br>
work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
.<br>
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
.<br>
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
.<br>
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction<br>
who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the<br>
work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the<br>
previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding<br>
Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor<br>
has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
.<br>
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
.<br>
11. Patents.<br>
.<br>
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
.<br>
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned<br>
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter<br>
acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this<br>
License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do<br>
not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of<br>
further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this<br>
definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in<br>
a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.<br>
.<br>
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
.<br>
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
.<br>
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to<br>
copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
.<br>
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
.<br>
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the<br>
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on<br>
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically<br>
granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you<br>
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the<br>
business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the<br>
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work,<br>
and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would<br>
receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a)<br>
in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or<br>
copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection<br>
with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work,<br>
unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was<br>
granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
.<br>
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any<br>
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be<br>
available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
.<br>
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
.<br>
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under<br>
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence<br>
you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that<br>
obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to<br>
whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those<br>
terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the<br>
Program.<br>
.<br>
13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public<br>
License.<br>
.<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the<br>
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users<br>
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your<br>
version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the<br>
Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the<br>
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some<br>
standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software.  This<br>
Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any<br>
work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is<br>
incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.<br>
.<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version<br>
3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
.<br>
14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
.<br>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
.<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
.<br>
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions<br>
of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
.<br>
Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
.<br>
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
.<br>
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT<br>
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT<br>
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A<br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE<br>
OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU<br>
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
.<br>
16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
.<br>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR<br>
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES<br>
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT<br>
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES<br>
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO<br>
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY<br>
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
.<br>
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
.<br>
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
.<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
.<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
.<br>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these<br>
terms.<br>
.<br>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to<br>
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state<br>
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
.<br>
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br>
.<br>
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the<br>
License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
.<br>
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but<br>
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br>
Affero General Public License for more details.<br>
.<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public<br>
License along with this program.  If not, see<br>
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
.<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper<br>
mail.<br>
.<br>
If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer<br>
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to<br>
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its<br>
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive<br>
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different<br>
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the<br>
specific requirements.<br>
.<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow<br>
the GNU AGPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
