1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,<br>
please let us know!)<br>
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.<br>
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a<br>
program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that<br>
you've used the IJG code.<br>
.<br>
In legalese:<br>
The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,<br>
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or<br>
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,<br>
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.<br>
.<br>
This software is copyright (C) 1991-2010, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.<br>
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.<br>
.<br>
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this<br>
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these<br>
conditions:<br>
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this<br>
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice<br>
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files<br>
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.<br>
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying<br>
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of<br>
the Independent JPEG Group".<br>
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts<br>
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept<br>
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.<br>
.<br>
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,<br>
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to<br>
acknowledge us.<br>
.<br>
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name<br>
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from<br>
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's<br>
software".<br>
.<br>
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of<br>
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are<br>

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,<br>
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA<br>
.<br>
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead<br>
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,<br>
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file<br>
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part<br>
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than<br>
the foregoing paragraphs do.<br>
.<br>
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.<br>
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.<br>
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,<br>
ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium<br>
but is also freely distributable.<br>
.<br>
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.<br>
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has<br>
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce<br>
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the<br>
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard<br>
GIF decoders.<br>
.<br>
We are required to state that<br>
"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of<br>
CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of<br>
CompuServe Incorporated."<br>
