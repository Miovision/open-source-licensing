<br>
Debian adaptions for these packages are licensed under the GNU General<br>
Public License, version 2, and are under Copyright by:<br>

2. License of the TeX live distribution as a compilation work<br>
<br>
<br>
COPYING CONDITIONS FOR TeX Live:<br>
<br>
To the best of our knowledge, all software in the TeX Live distribution<br>
is freely redistributable (libre, that is, not necessarily gratis),<br>
within the Free Software Foundation's definition and the Debian Free<br>
Software Guidelines.  Where the two conflict, we generally follow the<br>
FSF.  If you find any non-free files included, please contact us<br>
(references given at the end).<br>
<br>
That said, TeX Live has neither a single copyright holder nor a single<br>
license covering its entire contents, since it is a collection of many<br>
independent packages.  Therefore, you may copy, modify, and/or<br>
redistribute software from TeX Live only if you comply with the<br>
requirements placed thereon by the owners of the respective packages.<br>
<br>
To most easily learn these requirements, we suggest checking the TeX<br>
Catalogue at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/ (or any<br>
CTAN mirror).  Of course the legal statements within the packages<br>
themselves are the final authority.<br>
<br>
In some cases, TeX Live is distributed with a snapshot of the CTAN<br>
archive, which is entirely independent of and separable from TeX Live<br>
itself.  (The TeX Collection DVD is one example of this.)  Please be<br>
aware that the CTAN snapshot contains many files which are *not* freely<br>
redistributable; see LICENSE.CTAN for more information.<br>
<br>
<br>
GUIDELINES FOR REDISTRIBUTION:<br>
<br>
In general, you may redistribute TeX Live, with or without modification,<br>
for profit or not, according to the usual free software tenets.  Here<br>
are some general guidelines for doing this:<br>
<br>
- If you make any changes to the TeX Live distribution or any<br>
package it contains, besides complying with any licensing requirements,<br>
you must prominently mention such changes in your modified distribution<br>
so that users do not take your work for ours, and know to contact you,<br>
not us, in case of questions or problems.  A new top-level file<br>
README.<yourwork> is a good place to describe the general situation.<br>
<br>
- Especially (but not necessarily) if changes or additions are made, we<br>
recommend a clearly different title, such as "<your work> DVD, based on<br>
TeX Live YYYY", where YYYY is the year of TeX Live you are using.  This<br>
credits both our work and yours.<br>
<br>
- You absolutely may *not* place your own copyright on the entire<br>
distribution, since it is not your work.  Statements such as "all rights<br>
reserved" and "may not be reproduced" are especially reprehensible,<br>
since they are antithetical to the free software principles under which<br>
TeX Live is produced.<br>
<br>
- You may use any cover or media label designs that you wish.  Such<br>
packaging and marketing details are not covered by any TeX Live license.<br>
<br>
- Finally, we make the following requests (not legal requirements):<br>
<br>
a) Acknowledging that TeX Live is developed as a joint effort by all TeX<br>
user groups, and encouraging the user/reader to join their user group<br>
of choice, as listed on the web page http://tug.org/usergroups.html.<br>
<br>
b) Referencing the TeX Live home page: http://tug.org/texlive/<br>
<br>
Such information may be placed on the label of your media, your cover,<br>
and/or in accompanying text (for instance, in the acknowledgements<br>
section of a book).<br>
<br>
Finally, although it is again not a requirement, we'd like to invite any<br>
redistributors to make a donation to the project, whether cash or<br>
in-kind, for example via https://www.tug.org/donate/dev.html.  Thanks.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you have any questions or comments, *please* contact us.  In general,<br>
we appreciate being given the chance to review any TeX Live-related<br>
material in advance of publication, simply to avoid mistakes.  It is<br>
much better to correct text on a CD label or in a book before thousands<br>
of copies are made!<br>
<br>
We are also happy to keep anyone planning a publication informed as to<br>
our deadlines and progress.  Just let us know.  However, be aware that<br>
TeX Live is produced entirely by volunteers, and no dates can be<br>
guaranteed.<br>
<br>
<br>
LICENSING FOR NEW PACKAGES:<br>
<br>
Finally, we are often asked what license to use for new work.  To be<br>
considered for inclusion on TeX Live, a package must use a free software<br>
license, such as the LaTeX Project Public License, the GNU General<br>
Public License, the modified BSD license, etc.  (Please use an existing<br>
license instead of making up your own.)  Furthermore, all sources must<br>
be available, including for documentation files.  Please see<br>
http://tug.org/texlive/pkgcontrib.html for more information, and other<br>
considerations.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your interest in TeX.<br>
<br>
- Karl Berry, for the TeX Live project<br>

LPPL Version 1.3c  2006-05-20<br>
<br>
Copyright 1999 2002-2006 LaTeX3 Project<br>
Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this<br>
license document, but modification of it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
PREAMBLE<br>
========<br>
<br>
The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under<br>
which the the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.<br>
<br>
You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright<br>
and which you wish to distribute.  This license may be particularly<br>
suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but<br>
it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is<br>
unrelated to TeX.<br>
<br>
The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',<br>
below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors<br>
who are considering distributing their works under this license.<br>
<br>
This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed<br>
and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of<br>
that work may be distributed.<br>
<br>
We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you<br>
the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work<br>
that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while<br>
maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of<br>
that work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while<br>
meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'<br>
and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.<br>
<br>
<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
===========<br>
<br>
In this license document the following terms are used:<br>
<br>
`Work'<br>
Any work being distributed under this License.<br>
<br>
`Derived Work'<br>
Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.<br>
<br>
`Modification'<br>
Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable<br>
law -- for example, the production of a file containing an<br>
original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of<br>
such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or<br>
translated into another language.<br>
<br>
`Modify'<br>
To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any<br>
applicable law.<br>
<br>
`Distribution'<br>
Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in<br>
whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)<br>
making any electronic components of the Work accessible by<br>
file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file<br>
systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).<br>
<br>
`Compiled Work'<br>
A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it<br>
is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may<br>
include using installation facilities provided by the Work,<br>
transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or<br>
other activities.  Note that modification of any installation<br>
facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.<br>
<br>
`Current Maintainer'<br>
A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is<br>
no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under<br>
any applicable law.<br>
<br>
`Base Interpreter'<br>
A program or process that is normally needed for running or<br>
interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.<br>
<br>
A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these<br>
are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each<br>
external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used<br>
interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the<br>
license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a<br>
`LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the<br>
`LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
===========================================<br>
<br>
1.  Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work<br>
are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In<br>
particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no<br>
requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.<br>
<br>
2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you<br>
received it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered<br>
modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived<br>
Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.<br>
<br>
3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a<br>
complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2<br>
above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that<br>
the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly<br>
as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work<br>
directly from the Work.<br>
<br>
4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without<br>
restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may<br>
also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including<br>
Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works<br>
distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to<br>
be updated versions of the Work.<br>
<br>
5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify<br>
your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,<br>
and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on<br>
the Derived Work.<br>
<br>
6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may<br>
distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met<br>
for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states<br>
in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only<br>
the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption<br>
to a component of the Work.<br>
<br>
a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement<br>
for a component of the Work when that component is used with the<br>
Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work<br>
identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that<br>
Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work<br>
clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version<br>
of this component to the user when used interactively with that<br>
Base Interpreter.<br>
<br>
b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices<br>
detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a<br>
prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part<br>
of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log<br>
of the changes.<br>
<br>
c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,<br>
including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version<br>
of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)<br>
the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the<br>
Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that<br>
they do provide such support for the Derived Work.<br>
<br>
d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:<br>
<br>
1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work;<br>
if your distribution of a modified component is made by<br>
offering access to copy the modified component from a<br>
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy<br>
the Work from the same or some similar place meets this<br>
condition, even though third parties are not compelled to<br>
copy the Work along with the modified component;<br>
<br>
2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,<br>
unmodified copy of the Work.<br>
<br>
7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may<br>
distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as<br>
the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled<br>
Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with<br>
regard to the Derived Work.<br>
<br>
8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not<br>
apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it<br>
becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as<br>
it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.<br>
<br>
9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative<br>
format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is<br>
then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or<br>
nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of<br>
applying that process.<br>
<br>
10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license<br>
provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in<br>
Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have<br>
to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.<br>
<br>
b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that<br>
Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of<br>
itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the<br>
restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.<br>
<br>
11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to<br>
the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating<br>
such works with the Work by any means.<br>
<br>
12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent<br>
complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.<br>
<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
===========<br>
<br>
There is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in<br>
writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without<br>
warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not<br>
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a<br>
particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance<br>
of the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you assume<br>
the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.<br>
<br>
In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing<br>
will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the<br>
Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as<br>
permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,<br>
special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of<br>
the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited<br>
to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by<br>
anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other<br>
programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other<br>
party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
<br>
MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK<br>
=======================<br>
<br>
The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder<br>
explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in<br>
the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder<br>
or simply that it is `author-maintained'.<br>
<br>
The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer<br>
who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error<br>
reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail<br>
address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge<br>
or act upon these error reports.<br>
<br>
The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there<br>
is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current<br>
Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means<br>
of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other<br>
significant signs of active maintenance.<br>
<br>
You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with<br>
any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.<br>
<br>
If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of<br>
the Work through the following steps:<br>
<br>
1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and<br>
the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of<br>
an Internet or similar search.<br>
<br>
2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work<br>
is still maintained.<br>
<br>
a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer<br>
to update their communication data within one month.<br>
<br>
b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active<br>
maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce<br>
within the pertinent community your intention to take over<br>
maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be<br>
done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)<br>
<br>
3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass<br>
maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect<br>
immediately upon announcement.<br>
<br>
b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright<br>
Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,<br>
then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.<br>
<br>
4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above<br>
and after three months your intention is challenged neither by<br>
the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other<br>
people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as<br>
to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.<br>
<br>
5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes<br>
reachable once more within three months of a change completed<br>
under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must<br>
become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided<br>
they then update their communication data within one month.<br>
<br>
A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact<br>
that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.<br>
<br>
If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should<br>
immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous<br>
statement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also<br>
announce your new status to the same pertinent community as<br>
in 2b) above.<br>
<br>
<br>
WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE<br>
======================================================<br>
<br>
This section contains important instructions, examples, and<br>
recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their<br>
works under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in<br>
this section.<br>
<br>
Choosing This License or Another License<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*<br>
conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then<br>
do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,<br>
distribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text<br>
of this license as a model for your own license, but your license<br>
should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that<br>
your work is distributed under the LPPL.<br>
<br>
The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains<br>
the motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,<br>
for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public<br>
License (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is<br>
unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be<br>
relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any<br>
license are encouraged to read it.<br>
<br>
A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own<br>
personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for<br>
distributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such<br>
modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by<br>
accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or<br>
it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified<br>
version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions<br>
of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,<br>
cause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your<br>
best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public<br>
one.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work<br>
without altering any of its licensed components.<br>
<br>
How to Use This License<br>
-----------------------<br>
<br>
To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both<br>
an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work<br>
was authored and/or last substantially modified.  Include also a<br>
statement that the distribution and/or modification of that<br>
component is constrained by the conditions in this license.<br>
<br>
Here is an example of such a notice and statement:<br>
<br>
%% pig.dtx<br>
%% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name<br>
%<br>
% This work may be distributed and/or modified under the<br>
% conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3<br>
% of this license or (at your option) any later version.<br>
% The latest version of this license is in<br>
%   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt<br>
% and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX<br>
% version 2005/12/01 or later.<br>
%<br>
% This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.<br>
%<br>
% The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.<br>
%<br>
% This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins<br>
% and the derived file pig.sty.<br>
<br>
Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions<br>
given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring<br>
to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being<br>
generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'<br>
referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and<br>
`Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.<br>
<br>
If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your<br>
Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.<br>
However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance<br>
section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to<br>
the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it<br>
yourself.<br>
<br>
Derived Works That Are Not Replacements<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and<br>
stability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves<br>
with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a<br>
(compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If<br>
this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a<br>
completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.<br>
<br>
<br>
Important Recommendations<br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
Defining What Constitutes the Work<br>
<br>
The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the<br>
files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a<br>
way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.<br>
This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the<br>
files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by<br>
using a line such as:<br>
<br>
% This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.<br>
<br>
in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be<br>
impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you<br>
to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be<br>
entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise<br>
the Work.<br>
