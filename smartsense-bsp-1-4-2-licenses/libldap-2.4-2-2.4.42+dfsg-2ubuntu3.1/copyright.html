This package was downloaded from:<br>
<br>
<http://www.openldap.org/><br>
<br>
The upstream distribution has been repackaged to remove the RFCs and<br>
Internet-Drafts included in the upstream distribution, since the Internet<br>
Society license does not meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines.  The<br>
schema files that contain verbatim text from RFCs or Internet-Drafts have<br>
similarly been removed and are replaced during the package build with<br>
versions stripped of the literal RFC or Internet-Draft text.<br>

This license was present in the copies of several schema files and one<br>
LDIF file as distributed upstream.  The relevant content has been removed<br>
except where it is purely functional (descriptions of an LDAP schema).<br>
The copyright notice has been retained with a clarifying comment.  The<br>
provisions in the above license that prohibit modification therefore<br>
should no longer apply to any files distributed with the Debian package.<br>
<br>
Several files in libraries/libldap also reference this license as the<br>
copyright on ABNF sequences embedded as comments in those files.  These<br>
too are purely functional interface specifications distributed as part of<br>
the LDAP protocol standard and do not contain creative work such as<br>
free-form text.<br>

Hi Stephen,<br>
<br>
I don't see how this conflicts with the Debian FSG. The first statement<br>
in the copyright pertaining to CMU say only that we don't license out the<br>
software.  The second mention denies the right to say things like,<br>
"Now! Powered by software from Carnegie Mellon!"   There is no restriction<br>
on modifications and derived works.<br>

<br>
The OpenLDAP Foundation believes it the Regents' statement grants a<br>
license to redistribute derived works and is confident that the University,<br>
who is quite aware of our actions (as they actively participate in them),<br>
does not consider our actions to infringe on their rights.  You are<br>
welcomed to your opinions. I suggest, however, that before you rely<br>
on your or other people's opinions (including ours), that you consult<br>
with a lawyer familiar with applicable law and the particulars of your<br>
situation.<br>
<br>
The Foundation sees no reason for it to expend its limited resources<br>
seeking clarifications which it believes are unnecessary.  You are,<br>
of course, welcomed to expend time and energy seeking clarifications<br>
you think are necessary.  I suggest you contact University's general<br>
counsel office (http://www.umich.edu/~vpgc/).<br>
<br>
