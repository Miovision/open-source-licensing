Comment:<br>
XZ Utils is developed and maintained upstream by Lasse Collin.  Major<br>
portions are based on code by other authors; see AUTHORS for details.<br>
Most of the source has been put into the public domain, but some files<br>
have not (details below).<br>
.<br>
This file describes the source package.  The binary packages contain<br>
some files derived from other works: for example, images in the API<br>
documentation come from Doxygen.<br>
License:<br>
Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here<br>
is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this<br>
package (but check the individual files to be sure!):<br>
.<br>
- liblzma is in the public domain.<br>
.<br>
- xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public<br>
domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked<br>
in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under<br>
GNU LGPLv2.1+.<br>
.<br>
- The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been<br>
adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are<br>
under GNU GPLv2+.<br>
.<br>
- All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the<br>
XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories<br>
are in the public domain.<br>
.<br>
- Translated messages are in the public domain.<br>
.<br>
- The build system contains public domain files, and files that<br>
are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up<br>
in the binaries being built.<br>
.<br>
- Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging<br>
utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.<br>
.<br>
- The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files<br>
that are under various free software licenses.<br>
.<br>
You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into<br>
the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,<br>
take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find<br>
the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many<br>
lawyers.<br>
.<br>
As usual, this software is provided "as is", without any warranty.<br>
.<br>
If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils<br>
into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is<br>
polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but<br>
naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good<br>
notice to put into "about box" or into documentation:<br>
.<br>
This software includes code from XZ Utils <http://tukaani.org/xz/>.<br>
.<br>
The following license texts are included in the following files:<br>
- COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1<br>
- COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2<br>
- COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3<br>
.<br>
Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code<br>
pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma<br>
binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety<br>
even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source<br>
package.<br>
.<br>
If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more<br>
information.<br>

COPYING says that most docs are in the public domain. Maybe that's not<br>
clear enough, but on the other hand it looks a bit stupid to put<br>
copyright information in tiny and relatively small docs like README.<br>
.<br>
I don't dare to say that _all_ XZ Utils specific docs are in the public<br>
domain unless otherwise mentioned in the file. I'm including PDF files<br>
generated by groff + ps2pdf, and some day I might include Doxygen-<br>
generated HTML docs too. Those don't include any copyright notices, but<br>
it seems likely that groff + ps2pdf or at least Doxygen put some<br>
copyrighted content into the generated files.<br>

Comment:<br>
changelog.gz (commit 975d8fd) explains:<br>
.<br>
Recreated the BCJ test files for x86 and SPARC. The old files<br>
were linked with crt*.o, which are copyrighted, and thus the<br>
old test files were not in the public domain as a whole. They<br>
are freely distributable though, but it is better to be careful<br>
and avoid including any copyrighted pieces in the test files.<br>
The new files are just compiled and assembled object files,<br>
and thus don't contain any copyrighted code.<br>
