Parts of this software have been adapted from the libpng package. Although<br>
this library supports all features from the PNG specification (as MNG descends<br>
from it) it does not require the libpng package. It does require the zlib<br>
library and optionally the IJG jpeg library, and/or the "little-cms" library<br>
by Marti Maria (depending on the inclusion of support for JNG and<br>
Full-Color-Management respectively.<br>
.<br>
This library's function is primarily to read and display MNG animations. It is<br>
not meant as a full-featured image-editing component! It does however offer<br>
creation and editing functionality at the chunk level.(future modifications<br>
may include some more support for creation and or editing)<br>
