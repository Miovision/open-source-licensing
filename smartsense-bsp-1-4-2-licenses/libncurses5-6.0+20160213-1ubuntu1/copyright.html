This is the Debian prepackaged version of the ncurses<br>
library and terminfo utilities. ncurses/terminfo was originally written<br>
by Pavel Curtis and Zeyd M. Ben-Halim <zmbenhal@netcom.com>, and is<br>
currently held by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
This package was put together by Vaidhyanathan G Mayilrangam<br>
<vaidhy@debian.org> and Joel Klecker <espy@debian.org>, using sources<br>
obtained from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ncurses/ncurses-5.0.tar.gz.<br>
Current versions of the ncurses sources are found at<br>
ftp://invisible-island.net/ncurses/.<br>
<br>
It is based somewhat on work done by Bruce Perens <Bruce@Pixar.com>,<br>
David Engel <david@elo.ods.com>.  Michael Alan Dorman<br>
<mdorman@debian.org>, Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>, James Troup<br>
<jjtroup@comp.brad.ac.uk>, J.H.M. Dassen (Ray)<br>
<jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>, and Galen Hazelwood <galenh@micron.net><br>
over various years.<br>
