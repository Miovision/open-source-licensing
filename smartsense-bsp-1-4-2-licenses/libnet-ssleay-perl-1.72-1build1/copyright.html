Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.<br>
.<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this<br>
license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
.<br>
Preamble<br>
.<br>
This license establishes the terms under which a given free software<br>
Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.<br>
The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic<br>
control over the development of that Package while still keeping the<br>
Package available as open source and free software.<br>
.<br>
You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this<br>
license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the<br>
terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to<br>
make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek<br>
a different licensing arrangement.<br>
.<br>
Definitions<br>
.<br>
"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in<br>
the copyright notice for the entire Package.<br>
.<br>
"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other<br>
material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's<br>
procedures.<br>
.<br>
"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,<br>
or modify the Package.<br>
.<br>
"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright<br>
Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A<br>
given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a<br>
Modified Version.<br>
.<br>
"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it<br>
accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or<br>
organization, to others outside of your company or organization.<br>
.<br>
"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this<br>
Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It<br>
does not mean licensing fees.<br>
.<br>
"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,<br>
or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the<br>
Copyright Holder.<br>
.<br>
"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such<br>
changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.<br>
.<br>
"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the<br>
Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may<br>
be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.<br>
.<br>
"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and<br>
configuration files for the Package.<br>
.<br>
"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or<br>
any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation<br>
of the Source form.<br>
.<br>
Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution<br>
.<br>
(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use<br>
Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided<br>
that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.<br>
.<br>
Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version<br>
.<br>
(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the<br>
Standard Version of this Package in any medium without<br>
restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided<br>
that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and<br>
associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies<br>
may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.<br>
.<br>
(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other<br>
modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The<br>
resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version,<br>
and as such will be subject to the Original License.<br>
.<br>
Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source<br>
.<br>
(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis<br>
or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of<br>
the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it<br>
differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to,<br>
documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules,<br>
and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:<br>
.<br>
(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder<br>
of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that<br>
the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the<br>
Standard Version.<br>
(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not<br>
prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version.<br>
In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is<br>
different from the name of the Standard Version.<br>
(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to<br>
make the Source form of the Modified Version available to<br>
others under<br>
(i)  the Original License or<br>
(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,<br>
modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the<br>
same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the<br>
licensee received, and requires that the Source form of<br>
the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it,<br>
be made freely available in that license fees are<br>
prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.<br>
.<br>
Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified<br>
Versions without the Source<br>
.<br>
(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without<br>
the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on<br>
how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions<br>
must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these<br>
instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such<br>
distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions<br>
on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid<br>
instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you<br>
become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not<br>
forfeit any of your rights under this license.<br>
.<br>
(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without<br>
the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect<br>
to the Source of the Modified Version.<br>
.<br>
Aggregating or Linking the Package<br>
.<br>
(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or<br>
Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the<br>
resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing<br>
fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing<br>
fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The<br>
terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the<br>
Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.<br>
.<br>
(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with<br>
other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own,<br>
or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of<br>
applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result<br>
without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct<br>
interface to the Package.<br>
.<br>
Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version<br>
.<br>
(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that<br>
merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves,<br>
cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such<br>
works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are<br>
not subject to the terms of this license.<br>
.<br>
General Provisions<br>
.<br>
(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or<br>
Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By<br>
using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this<br>
license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you<br>
do not accept this license.<br>
.<br>
(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified<br>
Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless<br>
required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with<br>
the requirements of this license.<br>
.<br>
(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,<br>
service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.<br>
.<br>
(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,<br>
free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to<br>
sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to<br>
any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are<br>
necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent<br>
litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against<br>
any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or<br>
contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to<br>
you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.<br>
.<br>
(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br>
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE<br>

REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE<br>
LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL<br>
DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN<br>
IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.<br>
