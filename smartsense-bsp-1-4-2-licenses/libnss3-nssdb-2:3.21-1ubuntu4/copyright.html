=== MPL<br>
<br>
Note on GPL Compatibility<br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
The MPL 2, section 3.3, permits you to combine NSS with code under the GNU<br>
General Public License (GPL) version 2, or any later version of that<br>
license, to make a Larger Work, and distribute the result under the GPL.<br>
The only condition is that you must also make NSS, and any changes you<br>
have made to it, available to recipients under the terms of the MPL 2 also.<br>
<br>
Anyone who receives the combined code from you does not have to continue<br>
to dual licence in this way, and may, if they wish, distribute under the<br>
terms of either of the two licences - either the MPL alone or the GPL<br>
alone. However, we discourage people from distributing copies of NSS under<br>
the GPL alone, because it means that any improvements they make cannot be<br>
reincorporated into the main version of NSS. There is never a need to do<br>
this for license compatibility reasons.<br>
<br>
Note on LGPL Compatibility<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
The above also applies to combining MPLed code in a single library with<br>
code under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1, or<br>
any later version of that license. If the LGPLed code and the MPLed code<br>
are not in the same library, then the copyleft coverage of the two<br>
licences does not overlap, so no issues arise.<br>

Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,<br>

distributes such Contribution.<br>
<br>
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope<br>
<br>
The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under<br>
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the<br>
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.<br>
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a<br>
Contributor:<br>
<br>
(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;<br>
or<br>
<br>

modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its<br>
Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor<br>
Version); or<br>
<br>
(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of<br>
its Contributions.<br>
<br>
This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,<br>
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with<br>
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br>
<br>
2.4. Subsequent Licenses<br>
<br>
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to<br>
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this<br>
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if<br>
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).<br>
<br>
2.5. Representation<br>
<br>
Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its<br>
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights<br>
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.<br>
<br>
2.6. Fair Use<br>
<br>
This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under<br>
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other<br>
equivalents.<br>
<br>
2.7. Conditions<br>
<br>
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted<br>
in Section 2.1.<br>
<br>
3. Responsibilities<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
3.1. Distribution of Source Form<br>
<br>
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any<br>
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under<br>
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source<br>
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this<br>
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not<br>
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code<br>
Form.<br>
<br>
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br>
<br>
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br>
<br>
(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code<br>
Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of<br>
the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code<br>
Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more<br>
than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<br>
<br>
(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this<br>
License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the<br>
license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter<br>
the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.<br>
<br>
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br>
<br>
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,<br>
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for<br>
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered<br>
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the<br>
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this<br>
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software<br>
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of<br>
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered<br>
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary<br>
License(s).<br>
<br>
3.4. Notices<br>
<br>
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices<br>
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,<br>
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of<br>
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to<br>
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<br>
<br>
3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br>
<br>
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,<br>
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered<br>
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br>
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any<br>
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by<br>
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any<br>
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<br>
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional<br>
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any<br>
jurisdiction.<br>
<br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<br>
---------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br>
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to<br>
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br>
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br>
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must<br>
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered<br>
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute<br>
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a<br>
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br>
<br>
5. Termination<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically<br>
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become<br>
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular<br>
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such<br>
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an<br>
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the<br>
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have<br>
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular<br>
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor<br>
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the<br>
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License<br>
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after<br>
Your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent<br>
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,<br>
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version<br>
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to<br>
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section<br>
2.1 of this License shall terminate.<br>
<br>
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all<br>
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which<br>
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License<br>
prior to termination shall survive termination.<br>

*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *<br>
*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *<br>
*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *<br>
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *<br>
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *<br>
*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *<br>
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *<br>
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *<br>
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *<br>
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *<br>
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *<br>
*                                                                      *<br>

*  7. Limitation of Liability                                          *<br>
*  --------------------------                                          *<br>
*                                                                      *<br>
*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *<br>
*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *<br>
*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *<br>
*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *<br>
*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *<br>
*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *<br>
*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *<br>
*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      *<br>
*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   *<br>
*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *<br>
*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *<br>
*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *<br>
*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *<br>

*                                                                      *<br>
************************************************************************<br>
<br>
8. Litigation<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the<br>
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal<br>
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that<br>
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.<br>
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring<br>
cross-claims or counter-claims.<br>
<br>
9. Miscellaneous<br>
----------------<br>
<br>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject<br>
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br>
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br>
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides<br>
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter<br>
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.<br>
<br>
10. Versions of the License<br>
---------------------------<br>
<br>
10.1. New Versions<br>
<br>
Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section<br>
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or<br>
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a<br>
distinguishing version number.<br>
<br>
10.2. Effect of New Versions<br>
