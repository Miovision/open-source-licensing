A.1 GNU Free Documentation License<br>
==================================<br>
<br>
Version 1.1, March 2000<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
0. PREAMBLE<br>
<br>
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other<br>
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone<br>
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without<br>
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,<br>
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get<br>
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for<br>
modifications made by others.<br>
<br>
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative<br>
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.<br>
It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft<br>
license designed for free software.<br>
<br>
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for<br>
free software, because free software needs free documentation: a<br>
free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms<br>
that the software does.  But this License is not limited to<br>
software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless<br>
of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.<br>
We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is<br>
instruction or reference.<br>
<br>
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS<br>
<br>
This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a<br>
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed<br>
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to<br>
any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,<br>
and is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the<br>
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with<br>
modifications and/or translated into another language.<br>
<br>
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter<br>
section of the Document that deals exclusively with the<br>
relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the<br>
Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains<br>
nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.<br>
(For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of<br>
mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)<br>
The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with<br>
the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,<br>
philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.<br>
<br>
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose<br>
titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in<br>
the notice that says that the Document is released under this<br>
License.<br>
<br>
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are<br>
listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice<br>
that says that the Document is released under this License.<br>
<br>
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,<br>
represented in a format whose specification is available to the<br>
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly<br>
and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images<br>
composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some<br>
widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to<br>
text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of<br>
formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an<br>
otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed<br>
to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not<br>
Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".<br>
<br>
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain<br>
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,<br>
SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and<br>
standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.<br>
Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that<br>
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML<br>
or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally<br>
available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word<br>
processors for output purposes only.<br>
<br>
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,<br>
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the<br>
material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For<br>
works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title<br>
Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the<br>
work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.<br>
<br>
2. VERBATIM COPYING<br>
<br>
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either<br>
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the<br>
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License<br>
applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you<br>
add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You<br>
may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading<br>
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,<br>
you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you<br>
distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow<br>
the conditions in section 3.<br>
<br>
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,<br>
and you may publicly display copies.<br>
<br>
3. COPYING IN QUANTITY<br>
<br>
If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than<br>
100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you<br>
must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,<br>
all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and<br>
Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly<br>
and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The<br>
front cover must present the full title with all words of the<br>
title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material<br>
on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the<br>
covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and<br>
satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in<br>
other respects.<br>
<br>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit<br>
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit<br>
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto<br>
adjacent pages.<br>
<br>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document<br>
numbering more than 100, you must either include a<br>
machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or<br>
state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible<br>
computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy<br>
of the Document, free of added material, which the general<br>
network-using public has access to download anonymously at no<br>
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the<br>
latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you<br>
begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that<br>
this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated<br>
location until at least one year after the last time you<br>
distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or<br>
retailers) of that edition to the public.<br>
<br>
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of<br>
the Document well before redistributing any large number of<br>
copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated<br>
version of the Document.<br>
<br>
4. MODIFICATIONS<br>
<br>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document<br>
under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you<br>
release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with<br>
the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus<br>
licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to<br>
whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these<br>
things in the Modified Version:<br>
<br>
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title<br>
distinct from that of the Document, and from those of<br>
previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed<br>
in the History section of the Document).  You may use the<br>
same title as a previous version if the original publisher of<br>
that version gives permission.<br>
<br>
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or<br>
entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in<br>
the Modified Version, together with at least five of the<br>
principal authors of the Document (all of its principal<br>
authors, if it has less than five).<br>
<br>
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the<br>
Modified Version, as the publisher.<br>
<br>
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.<br>
<br>
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications<br>
adjacent to the other copyright notices.<br>
<br>
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license<br>
notice giving the public permission to use the Modified<br>
Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in<br>
the Addendum below.<br>
<br>
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant<br>
Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's<br>
license notice.<br>
<br>
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.<br>
<br>
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and<br>
add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new<br>
authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on<br>
the Title Page.  If there is no section entitled "History" in<br>
the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,<br>
and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,<br>
then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in<br>
the previous sentence.<br>
<br>
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document<br>
for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and<br>
likewise the network locations given in the Document for<br>
previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in<br>
the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a<br>
work that was published at least four years before the<br>
Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version<br>
it refers to gives permission.<br>
<br>
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications",<br>
preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all<br>
the substance and tone of each of the contributor<br>
acknowledgments and/or dedications given therein.<br>
<br>
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,<br>
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers<br>
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section<br>
titles.<br>
<br>
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section<br>
may not be included in the Modified Version.<br>
<br>
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to<br>
conflict in title with any Invariant Section.<br>
<br>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or<br>
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no<br>
material copied from the Document, you may at your option<br>
designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,<br>
add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified<br>
Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any<br>
other section titles.<br>
<br>
You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains<br>
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various<br>
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text<br>
has been approved by an organization as the authoritative<br>
definition of a standard.<br>
<br>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,<br>
and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end<br>
of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one<br>
passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be<br>
added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the<br>
Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,<br>
previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity<br>
you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may<br>
replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous<br>
publisher that added the old one.<br>
<br>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this<br>
License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to<br>
assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.<br>
<br>
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS<br>
<br>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under<br>
this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for<br>
modified versions, provided that you include in the combination<br>
all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,<br>
unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your<br>
combined work in its license notice.<br>
<br>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and<br>
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single<br>
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name<br>
but different contents, make the title of each such section unique<br>
by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the<br>
original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a<br>
unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in<br>
the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the<br>
combined work.<br>
<br>
In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled<br>
"History" in the various original documents, forming one section<br>
entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled<br>
"Acknowledgments", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You<br>
must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."<br>
<br>
6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS<br>
<br>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other<br>
documents released under this License, and replace the individual<br>
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy<br>
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the<br>
rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the<br>
documents in all other respects.<br>
<br>
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and<br>
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert<br>
a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow<br>
this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of<br>
that document.<br>
<br>
7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS<br>
<br>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other<br>
separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a<br>
Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation<br>
copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is<br>
called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the<br>
other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on<br>
account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves<br>
derivative works of the Document.<br>
<br>
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these<br>
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one<br>
quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be<br>
placed on covers that surround only the Document within the<br>
aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole<br>
aggregate.<br>
<br>
8. TRANSLATION<br>
<br>
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may<br>
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section<br>
4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special<br>
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include<br>
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the<br>
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a<br>
translation of this License provided that you also include the<br>
original English version of this License.  In case of a<br>
disagreement between the translation and the original English<br>
version of this License, the original English version will prevail.<br>
<br>
9. TERMINATION<br>
<br>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document<br>
except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other<br>
attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this<br>
License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,<br>
from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE<br>
<br>
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of<br>
the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See<br>
`http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.<br>
<br>
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version<br>
number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered<br>
version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you<br>
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of<br>
that specified version or of any later version that has been<br>
published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If<br>
the Document does not specify a version number of this License,<br>
you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the<br>
Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
A.1.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of<br>
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license<br>
notices just after the title page:<br>
<br>
Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.<br>
Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document<br>
under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1<br>
or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;<br>
with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the<br>
Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.<br>
A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU<br>
Free Documentation License''.<br>
<br>
If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"<br>
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover<br>
Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being<br>
LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.<br>
<br>
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we<br>
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of<br>
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to<br>
permit their use in free software.<br>
