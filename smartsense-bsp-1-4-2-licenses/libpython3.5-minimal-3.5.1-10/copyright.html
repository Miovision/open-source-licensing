A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE<br>
==========================<br>
<br>
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting<br>
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands<br>
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's<br>
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.<br>
<br>
In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for<br>
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)<br>
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the<br>
software.<br>
<br>
In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to<br>
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same<br>
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope<br>
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software<br>
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a<br>
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related<br>
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of<br>
the PSF.<br>
<br>
All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for<br>
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python<br>
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes<br>
the various releases.<br>

Footnotes:<br>
<br>
(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under<br>
the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute<br>
a modified version without making your changes open source.  The<br>
GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with<br>
other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.<br>
<br>
(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,<br>
because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to<br>
CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1<br>
is "not incompatible" with the GPL.<br>
<br>
Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's<br>
direction to make these releases possible.<br>
