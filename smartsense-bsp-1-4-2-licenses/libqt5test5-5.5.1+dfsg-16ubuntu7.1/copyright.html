ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,<br>
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.<br>
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead<br>
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,<br>
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file<br>
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part<br>
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than<br>
the foregoing paragraphs do.<br>
.<br>
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.<br>
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.<br>
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,<br>
ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium<br>
but is also freely distributable.<br>
.<br>
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.<br>
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has<br>
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce<br>
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the<br>
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard<br>
GIF decoders.<br>
.<br>
We are required to state that<br>
"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of<br>

2.1, the object code form of a "work that uses the Library" may incorporate<br>
material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may distribute<br>
such object code under terms of your choice, provided that:<br>

structure layouts, accessors, macros, inline functions and<br>
templates; and<br>
(iii) you comply with the terms of Section 6 of the GNU Lesser General<br>

Library into the modified Library's header files unless such material is<br>
limited to (i) numerical parameters; (ii) data structure layouts;<br>
(iii) accessors; and (iv) small macros, templates and inline functions of<br>

Introduction<br>
============<br>
.<br>
The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;<br>
some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,<br>
various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the<br>
FreeType Project.<br>
.<br>
This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and<br>
which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license<br>
affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,<br>
documentation and makefiles, at the very least.<br>
.<br>
This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG<br>
(Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion<br>
and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products<br>
alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:<br>
.<br>
o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be<br>
interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)<br>
.<br>
o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or<br>
full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)<br>
.<br>
o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use<br>
it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge<br>
somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the<br>
FreeType code. (`credits')<br>
.<br>
We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this<br>
software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.<br>
We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and<br>
assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
Legal Terms<br>
===========<br>
.<br>
0. Definitions<br>
--------------<br>
.<br>
Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',<br>
and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally<br>
distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and<br>
Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,<br>
beta or final release.<br>
.<br>
`You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where<br>
`using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source<br>
code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.<br>
This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType<br>
engine'.<br>
.<br>
This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original<br>
FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and<br>
documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its<br>
original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.<br>
If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by<br>
this license, you must contact us to verify this.<br>
.<br>
The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,<br>
Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as<br>
specified below.<br>
.<br>
1. No Warranty<br>
--------------<br>
.<br>
THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,<br>
WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS<br>
BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO<br>
USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.<br>
.<br>
2. Redistribution<br>
-----------------<br>
.<br>
This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and<br>
irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,<br>
display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and<br>
sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code<br>
forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to<br>
authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted<br>
herein, subject to the following conditions:<br>
.<br>
o Redistribution  of source code  must retain this  license file<br>
(`LICENSE.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes<br>
to   the  original   files  must   be  clearly   indicated  in<br>
accompanying  documentation.   The  copyright notices  of  the<br>
unaltered, original  files must be preserved in  all copies of<br>
source files.<br>
.<br>
o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that<br>
states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the<br>
FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also<br>
encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your<br>
documentation, though this isn't mandatory.<br>
.<br>
These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on<br>
the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use<br>
our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid<br>
to us.<br>
.<br>
3. Advertising<br>
--------------<br>
.<br>
Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use<br>
the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional<br>
purposes without specific prior written permission.<br>
.<br>
We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the<br>
following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation<br>
or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',<br>
`FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.<br>
.<br>
As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to<br>
accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted<br>
material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the<br>
authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.<br>
Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType<br>
Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms<br>
of this license.<br>
.<br>
