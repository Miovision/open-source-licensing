.<br>
3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
.<br>
3.1. Availability of Source Code.<br>
.<br>
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make<br>
available in Executable form must also be made available in<br>
Source Code form and that Source Code form must be<br>
distributed only under the terms of this License. You must<br>
include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source<br>
Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or<br>
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any<br>
such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can<br>
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a<br>
reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used<br>
for software exchange.<br>
.<br>
3.2. Modifications.<br>
.<br>
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute<br>
are governed by the terms of this License. You represent<br>
that You believe Your Modifications are Your original<br>
creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the<br>
rights conveyed by this License.<br>
.<br>
3.3. Required Notices.<br>
.<br>
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that<br>
identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You<br>
may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark<br>
notices contained within the Covered Software, or any<br>
notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving<br>
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.<br>
.<br>
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.<br>
.<br>
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered<br>
Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the<br>
applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights<br>
hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,<br>
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one<br>
or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do<br>
so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial<br>
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely<br>
clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or<br>
liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby<br>
agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every<br>
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial<br>
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,<br>
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
.<br>
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
.<br>
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered<br>
Software under the terms of this License or under the terms<br>
of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms<br>
different from this License, provided that You are in<br>
compliance with the terms of this License and that the<br>
license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or<br>
alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from<br>
the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the<br>
Covered Software in Executable form under a different<br>
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms<br>
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not<br>
by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to<br>
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for<br>
any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such<br>
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.<br>
.<br>
3.6. Larger Works.<br>
.<br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software<br>
with other code not governed by the terms of this License<br>
and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such<br>
a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License<br>
are fulfilled for the Covered Software.<br>
.<br>
4. Versions of the License.<br>
.<br>
4.1. New Versions.<br>
.<br>
Oracle Corp. is the initial license steward and may publish<br>
revised and/or new versions of this License from time to<br>
time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version<br>
number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than<br>
the license steward has the right to modify this License.<br>
.<br>
4.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
.<br>
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make<br>
the Covered Software available under the terms of the<br>
version of the License under which You originally received<br>
the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a<br>
notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being<br>
distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent<br>
version of the License, You must distribute and make the<br>
Covered Software available under the terms of the version of<br>
the License under which You originally received the Covered<br>
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute<br>
or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the<br>
terms of any subsequent version of the License published by<br>
the license steward.<br>
.<br>
4.3. Modified Versions.<br>
.<br>
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a<br>
new license for Your Original Software, You may create and<br>
use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename<br>
the license and remove any references to the name of the<br>
license steward (except to note that the license differs<br>
from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the<br>
license contains terms which differ from this License.<br>
.<br>
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>
.<br>
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS<br>
IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR<br>
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE<br>
COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A<br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO<br>
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH<br>
YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY<br>
RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER<br>
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY<br>
CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY<br>
COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS<br>
DISCLAIMER.<br>
.<br>
6. TERMINATION.<br>
.<br>
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will<br>
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms<br>
herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of<br>
becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their<br>
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this<br>
License shall survive.<br>
.<br>
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding<br>
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a<br>
Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against<br>
whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")<br>
alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the<br>
Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor<br>
or the Original Software where the Participant is the<br>
Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any<br>
patent, then any and all rights granted directly or<br>
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer<br>
(if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all<br>
Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License<br>
shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate<br>
prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60<br>
day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You<br>
withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software<br>
against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to<br>
a written agreement with Participant.<br>
.<br>
6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2<br>
above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted<br>
by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination<br>
(excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall<br>
survive termination.<br>
.<br>
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
.<br>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER<br>
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL<br>
YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY<br>
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF<br>
SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,<br>
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY<br>
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST<br>
PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE<br>
OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR<br>
LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY<br>
SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<br>
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT<br>
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS<br>
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY<br>
NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
.<br>
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>
.<br>
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is<br>
defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of<br>
"commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at<br>
48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer<br>
software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R.<br>
12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48<br>
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S.<br>
Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only<br>
those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights<br>
clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR,<br>
or other clause or provision that addresses Government<br>
rights in computer software under this License.<br>
.<br>
9. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
.<br>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning<br>
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is<br>
held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed<br>
only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This<br>
License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction<br>
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software<br>
(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides<br>
otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law<br>
provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be<br>
subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the<br>
jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained<br>
within the Original Software, with the losing party<br>
responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court<br>
costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The<br>
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts<br>
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.<br>
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a<br>
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not<br>
apply to this License. You agree that You alone are<br>
responsible for compliance with the United States export<br>
administration regulations (and the export control laws and<br>
regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute<br>
or otherwise make available any Covered Software.<br>
.<br>
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br>
.<br>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each<br>
party is responsible for claims and damages arising,<br>
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights<br>
under this License and You agree to work with Initial<br>
Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility<br>
on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall<br>
be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<br>

EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS BASED ON BREACHES OF CONFIDENTIALITY OR COPYRIGHT<br>
INFRINGEMENT, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY DIRECT,<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES<br>
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE EVEN IF ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS (as<br>
defined below), INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BREACH OF CONTRACT,<br>
BREACH OF WARRANTY, LIBRAW’S NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY,<br>
MISREPRESENTATION AND OTHER TORTS. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE<br>
CONTRARY IN SECTION 5(b) BELOW, LIBRAW WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR THE LOSS<br>
OF, OR DAMAGE TO, LICENSEE'S RECORDS OR DATA OR ANY DAMAGES CLAIMED BY<br>
LICENSEE BASED ON A THIRD PARTY CLAIM. The obligations of this Section<br>
shall expressly survive the revocation of this or any other related<br>
agreement.<br>
(b) Indemnification.<br>
Licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless LibRaw, its<br>
officers, members, agents and employees from and against any claims,<br>
demands, or causes of action whatsoever (collectively “Claims”) caused<br>
by, or arising out of, or resulting from, Licensee’s Use or<br>
Modification of the Software or any Derivative Work or the exercise or<br>
practice of the License by Licensee, its subsidiaries or their<br>
officers, employees, agents or representatives. LibRaw shall indemnify,<br>
defend and hold harmless Licensee, its officers, members, agents and<br>
employees from and against any Claims that the Software infringes any<br>
third party's patent or copyright, provided that Licensee promptly<br>
notifies LibRaw in writing of such Claim, LibRaw has sole control over<br>
the defense of the Claim and/or any settlement negotiations, and<br>
Licensee cooperates fully in the defense of the Claim. At its option,<br>
LibRaw may, in lieu of defending any infringement Claim, obtain the<br>
right for Licensee to continue using the Software or terminate this<br>
License, including any licenses granted herein. The foregoing states<br>
LibRaw’s entire obligation to Licensee for indemnification of third<br>
party infringement Claims.<br>

Term”). The Initial Term and any Renewal Term are collectively the<br>
“Term”.<br>
(b) Revocation with Cause.<br>

(iv) if Licensee becomes insolvent or admits in writing its<br>
inability to pay its debts as they mature, or makes an<br>
assignment for the benefit of creditors; (v) if a petition<br>
under any foreign, state, or United States bankruptcy act,<br>
receivership statute, or the like, as they now exist, or as<br>
they may be amended, is filed by Licensee; or (vi) if such<br>
petition is filed by any third party, or an application for a<br>
receiver is made by anyone against Licensee and such petition<br>
or application is not resolved favorably within ninety (90)<br>
days.<br>
(c) Consequences and Obligations of Revocation.<br>
If this License is revoked for any reason, then Licensee's rights under<br>
this License will immediately terminate. Licensee agrees upon<br>

Modifying of the Software and any Derivative Work, and further to<br>
destroy all full or partial copies of the Software and any Derivative<br>
Work in Licensee’s possession or under its Control. The obligations of<br>
this Section shall expressly survive the revocation of this or any<br>
other related agreement.<br>
.<br>
7. CONFIDENTIALITY.<br>
(a) General.<br>
Either Party or its employees or agents may, in the course of<br>
performing their responsibilities under this License, be exposed to or<br>
acquire information, which is proprietary or confidential to the other<br>
Party or to third parties to whom that other Party owes a duty of<br>
confidentiality. Any and all non-public information of any form<br>
obtained by a Party or its employees or agents while performing this<br>
License shall be deemed to be confidential and proprietary information.<br>
The receiving Party shall hold such information in strict confidence<br>
and not copy, record, reproduce (using any medium), sell, assign,<br>
license,market, transfer or otherwise dispose of, give or disclose such<br>
information to third parties (except to third parties who are bound to<br>
the receiving Party by a like obligation of confidentiality and who<br>
have a need to access the confidential information for purposes of this<br>
License) or use such information for any purposes whatsoever other than<br>
in the performance of this License and will advise each of its<br>
employees and agents who may be exposed to such proprietary and<br>
confidential information of their obligations to keep such information<br>
confidential. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that any breach of this<br>
Section 7 will constitute a material breach of the License entitling<br>
LibRaw to terminate this License under Section 6(b) herein. The<br>
obligations of this Section shall expressly survive the revocation of<br>
this or any other related agreement.<br>
(b) Exceptions.<br>

public domain other than by disclosure by the receiving Party in<br>
violation of this License; (ii) demonstrably known to the receiving<br>
Party previously, (iii) independently developed by the receiving Party<br>

copyright or other proprietary notice appearing on the Software or<br>

In performing this License, the Parties act and will act at all times<br>
as independent contractors, and nothing contained in this License will<br>

(c) Waiver.<br>
No waiver under this License will be valid or binding unless set forth<br>
in writing and duly executed by the Party against whom enforcement of<br>
such waiver is sought. Any such waiver will constitute a waiver only<br>
with respect to the specific matter described therein and will in no<br>
way impair the rights of the Party granting such waiver in any other<br>
respect orat any other time. Any delay or forbearance by either Party<br>
in exercising any right hereunder will not be deemed a waiver of that<br>
right.<br>
(d) Governing Law.<br>
This License shall be governed and construed in accordance with the<br>
laws of the State of Maryland without regard to the conflicts of laws<br>
or principles thereof. Any Claim related to this License or between the<br>
Parties must be brought exclusively in the Circuit Court sitting in<br>
Montgomery County, Maryland or the U.S. District Court for the District<br>
of Maryland, and the Parties irrevocably submit and consent to such<br>
jurisdiction and venue and waive any right they may have to seek any<br>
change of jurisdiction or venue. The obligations of this Section shall<br>
expressly survive the revocation of this or any other related<br>
agreement.<br>
(e) Counterparts.<br>
This License may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of<br>
which when so executed will be deemed to be an original and all of<br>
which when taken together will constitute one agreement.<br>
(f) Headings; Interpretation.<br>

without regard to the identity of the drafter of any provision in this<br>
License.<br>
(g) Entire Agreement.<br>
This License constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between<br>
the Parties as to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior<br>
discussions between the Parties, and neither Party shall be bound by<br>
any conditions, definitions, warranties, understandings or<br>
representations with respect to such subject matter other than as<br>
expressly provided herein. This License may not be modified or amended<br>
or supplemented except in writing executed by the duly authorized<br>
representatives of both Parties. If any provision of this License is<br>
declared to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalid or unenforceable<br>
provision, shall be deemed struck from this License, but only in the<br>
jurisdiction in which such provision was declared invalid or<br>
unenforceable, and the enforceability of the remaining provisions of<br>
this License shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. This<br>
License shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties<br>
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and shall<br>
not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person not a party hereto.<br>
The obligations of this Section shall expressly survive the revocation<br>
of this or any other related agreement.<br>
(h) Construction.<br>
This License will also supersede all terms of any unsigned or<br>
“shrink-wrap” license including in any package, media or electronic<br>
version of the Software and any such Software will be licensed solely<br>
under the terms of this License. When executed and dated by both<br>
Parties, any order forms that reference this License and its Effective<br>
Date will be incorporated in this License by reference.<br>

deemed to include all genders.<br>

COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY<br>
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS<br>
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.<br>
.<br>
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO<br>
BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE<br>

1. Definitions<br>
"Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and<br>
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative<br>
work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or<br>
artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic<br>
adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast,<br>
transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from<br>
the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not<br>
be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the<br>
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or<br>
phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a<br>
moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the<br>
purpose of this License.<br>
"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as<br>
encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or<br>
broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in<br>
Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of<br>
their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is<br>
included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other<br>
contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in<br>
themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work<br>
that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as<br>
defined below) for the purposes of this License.<br>

have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of<br>
this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of<br>
adaptations of works made available under that license under this<br>
License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License<br>
Elements as this License.<br>
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and<br>

of this License including without limitation any production in the<br>
literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or<br>

compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable<br>
work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent<br>
it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.<br>

to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to<br>
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.<br>

to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or<br>

performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that<br>
members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place<br>

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,<br>
limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from<br>
limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the<br>
copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.<br>
.<br>
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,<br>
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,<br>
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to<br>
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:<br>
.<br>
to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more<br>
Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the<br>
Collections;<br>
to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,<br>
including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to<br>
clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to<br>
the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The<br>
original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification<br>
could indicate "The original work has been modified.";<br>
to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in<br>
Collections; and,<br>
to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.<br>
.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt:<br>
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br>
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br>
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves<br>
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by<br>
You of the rights granted under this License;<br>
Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which<br>
the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory<br>
licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive<br>
right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the<br>
rights granted under this License; and,<br>
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect<br>
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor<br>
is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary<br>
licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the<br>
rights granted under this License.<br>
.<br>
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now<br>
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such<br>
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other<br>
media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly<br>
granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.<br>
.<br>
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made<br>
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:<br>
.<br>
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of<br>
this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource<br>
Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You<br>
Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on<br>
the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the<br>
recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient<br>
under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You<br>
must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the<br>
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or<br>
Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You<br>
may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that<br>
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the<br>
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This<br>
Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but<br>
this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be<br>
made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,<br>
upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,<br>
remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as<br>
requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor<br>
You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any<br>
credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.<br>
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the<br>
terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with<br>
the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons<br>
jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that<br>
contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,<br>
Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible<br>
License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses<br>
mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If<br>
you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses<br>
mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must<br>
comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the<br>
following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for,<br>
the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute<br>
or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the<br>
Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the<br>
ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights<br>
granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License;<br>
(III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable<br>
License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work<br>
as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV)<br>
when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not<br>
impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that<br>
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to<br>
exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the<br>
Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as<br>
incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection<br>
apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the<br>
Applicable License.<br>
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or<br>
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to<br>
Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and<br>
provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the<br>
name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,<br>
and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or<br>
parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for<br>
attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,<br>
terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or<br>
parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent<br>
reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be<br>
associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the<br>
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,<br>
consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit<br>
identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French<br>
translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on<br>
original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section<br>
4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,<br>
that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit<br>
will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation<br>
or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at<br>
least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this<br>
Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,<br>
by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or<br>
explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or<br>
endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,<br>
as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,<br>
express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or<br>
Attribution Parties.<br>
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be<br>
otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or<br>
Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations<br>
or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other<br>
derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to<br>
the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those<br>
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted<br>
in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be<br>
deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory<br>
action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the<br>
Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the<br>
fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You<br>
to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License<br>
(right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.<br>
.<br>
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer<br>
.<br>
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR<br>
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY<br>
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,<br>
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,<br>
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT<br>
OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER<br>
OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
.<br>
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE<br>
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY<br>
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN<br>
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
.<br>
7. Termination<br>
.<br>
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.<br>
Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections<br>
from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses<br>
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full<br>
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will<br>
survive any termination of this License.<br>
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is<br>
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).<br>
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the<br>
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at<br>
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to<br>
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is<br>
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this<br>
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as<br>
stated above.<br>
.<br>
8. Miscellaneous<br>
.<br>
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,<br>
the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same<br>
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.<br>
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor<br>
offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms<br>
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.<br>
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under<br>
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of<br>
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action<br>
by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to<br>
the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and<br>
enforceable.<br>
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no<br>
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing<br>
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.<br>
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with<br>
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,<br>
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified<br>
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may<br>
appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified<br>
without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.<br>
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this<br>
License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention<br>
for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on<br>
September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright<br>
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and<br>
the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These<br>
rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in<br>
which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the<br>
corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty<br>
provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of<br>
rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights<br>
not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be<br>
included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the<br>
license of any rights under applicable law.<br>
