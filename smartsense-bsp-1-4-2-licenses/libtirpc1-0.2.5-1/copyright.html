liability obligations to one or more recipients of Your<br>
version of the Code.  However, You may do so only<br>
<br>
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial<br>
Developer.  You must make it absolutely clear than any such<br>
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is<br>

liability terms You offer.<br>

Source Code version of the Original Code is available under<br>
the terms of this License.  The notice must be conspicuously<br>
included in any notice in an Executable or Source versions,<br>
related documentation or collateral in which You describe<br>
recipients' rights relating to the Original Code.  You may<br>
distribute the Executable and Source versions of Your<br>
version of the Code or ownership rights under a license of<br>
Your choice, which may contain terms different from this<br>
License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms<br>
of this License.  If You distribute the Executable and<br>
Source versions under a different license You must make it<br>
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this<br>
License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial<br>
Developer .  You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial<br>

requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Original<br>
Code.<br>
