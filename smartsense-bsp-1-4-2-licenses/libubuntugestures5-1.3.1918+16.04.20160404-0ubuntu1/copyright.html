License<br>
.<br>
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS<br>
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS<br>
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE<br>
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW<br>
IS PROHIBITED.<br>
.<br>
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND<br>
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU<br>
THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.<br>
.<br>
1. Definitions<br>
.<br>
1. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,<br>
anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in<br>
unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,<br>
constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are<br>
assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a<br>
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work<br>
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.<br>
2. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the<br>
Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical<br>
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture<br>
version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,<br>
condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,<br>
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a<br>
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the<br>
purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work<br>
is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of<br>
the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be<br>
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.<br>
3. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work<br>
under the terms of this License.<br>
4. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the<br>
Work.<br>
5. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under<br>
the terms of this License.<br>
6. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this<br>
License who has not previously violated the terms of this License<br>
with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission<br>
from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a<br>
previous violation.<br>
7. "License Elements" means the following high-level license<br>
attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of<br>
this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.<br>
.<br>
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,<br>
limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or<br>
other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under<br>
copyright law or other applicable laws.<br>
.<br>
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,<br>
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,<br>
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to<br>
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:<br>
.<br>
1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more<br>
Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the<br>
Collective Works;<br>
2. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;<br>
3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,<br>
perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio<br>
transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;<br>
4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,<br>
perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio<br>
transmission Derivative Works.<br>
5.<br>
.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical<br>
composition:<br>
1. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor<br>
waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually<br>
or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC),<br>
royalties for the public performance or public digital<br>
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.<br>
2. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives<br>
the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a<br>
music rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox<br>
Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the<br>
Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the<br>
compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US<br>
Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).<br>
6. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of<br>
doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the<br>
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a<br>
performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the<br>
public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to<br>
the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US<br>
Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).<br>
.<br>
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now<br>
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make<br>
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights<br>
in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by<br>
Licensor are hereby reserved.<br>
.<br>
4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly<br>
made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:<br>
.<br>
1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or<br>
publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this<br>
License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource<br>
Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the<br>
Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly<br>
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work<br>
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'<br>
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the<br>
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License<br>
and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,<br>
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform<br>
the Work with any technological measures that control access or use<br>
of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License<br>
Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a<br>
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart<br>
from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this<br>
License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any<br>
Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the<br>
Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested.<br>
If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You<br>
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work<br>
any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested.<br>
2. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or<br>
publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms<br>
of this License, a later version of this License with the same<br>
License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons<br>
license that contains the same License Elements as this License<br>
(e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan). You must include a copy of,<br>
or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other<br>
license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or<br>
phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly<br>
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may<br>
not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or<br>
restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of<br>
the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices<br>
that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.<br>
You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or<br>
publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any<br>
technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a<br>
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.<br>
The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a<br>
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work<br>
apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the<br>
terms of this License.<br>
3. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or<br>
publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or<br>
Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for<br>
the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are<br>
utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if<br>
applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or<br>
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor<br>
institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's<br>
copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the<br>
name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to<br>
the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier,<br>
if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,<br>
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing<br>
information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a<br>
credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,<br>
"French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay<br>
based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be<br>
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the<br>
case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such<br>
credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit<br>
appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other<br>
comparable authorship credit.<br>
.<br>
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer<br>
.<br>
UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS<br>
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND<br>
CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,<br>
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,<br>
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF<br>
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF<br>
ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW<br>
THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY<br>
TO YOU.<br>
.<br>
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE<br>
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR<br>
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES<br>
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR<br>
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
.<br>
7. Termination<br>
.<br>
1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.<br>
Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or<br>
Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have<br>
their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities<br>
remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,<br>
7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.<br>
2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted<br>
here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in<br>
the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to<br>
release the Work under different license terms or to stop<br>
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such<br>
election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other<br>
license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms<br>
of this License), and this License will continue in full force and<br>
effect unless terminated as stated above.<br>
.<br>
8. Miscellaneous<br>
.<br>
1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work<br>
or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license<br>
to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted<br>
to You under this License.<br>
2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a<br>
Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the<br>
original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license<br>
granted to You under this License.<br>
3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under<br>
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of<br>
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further<br>
action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be<br>
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision<br>
valid and enforceable.<br>
4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and<br>
no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in<br>
writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or<br>
consent.<br>
5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties<br>
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,<br>
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified<br>
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that<br>
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be<br>
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and<br>
You.<br>
.<br>
Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty<br>
whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be<br>
liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages<br>
whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,<br>
incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this<br>
license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative<br>
Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder,<br>
it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.<br>
.<br>

Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark<br>
"Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons<br>
without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted<br>
