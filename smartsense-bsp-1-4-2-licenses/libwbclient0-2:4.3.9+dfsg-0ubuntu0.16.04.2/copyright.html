Intellectual Property Rights Notice for Protocol Documentation.<br>
.<br>
Copyrights.<br>
This protocol documentation is covered by Microsoft copyrights. Regardless<br>
of any other terms that are contained in the terms of use for the Microsoft<br>
website that hosts this documentation, you may make copies of it in order to<br>
develop implementations of the protocols, and may distribute portions of it<br>
in your implementations of the protocols or your documentation as necessary<br>
to properly document the implementation. You may also distribute in your<br>
implementation, with or without modification, any schema, IDL’s, or code<br>
samples that are included in the documentation. This permission also applies<br>
to any documents that are referenced in the protocol documentation.<br>
.<br>
No Trade Secrets.<br>
Microsoft does not claim any trade secret rights in this documentation.<br>
.<br>
Patents.<br>
Microsoft has patents that may cover your implementations of the protocols.<br>
Neither this notice nor Microsoft's delivery of the documentation grants any<br>
licenses under those or any other Microsoft patents. However, the protocols<br>
may be covered by Microsoft's Open Specification Promise (available here:<br>
http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp). If you would prefer a written<br>
license, or if the protocols are not covered by the OSP, patent<br>
licenses are available by contacting protocol@microsoft.com.<br>
.<br>
Trademarks.<br>
The names of companies and products contained in this documentation may be<br>
covered by trademarks or similar intellectual property rights. This notice<br>
does not grant any licenses under those rights.<br>
.<br>
Reservation of Rights.<br>
All other rights are reserved, and this notice does not grant any rights<br>
other than specifically described above, whether by implication, estoppel,<br>
or otherwise.<br>
.<br>
Tools.<br>
This protocol documentation is intended for use in conjunction with<br>
publicly available standard specifications and network programming art,<br>
and assumes that the reader either is familiar with the aforementioned<br>
material or has immediate access to it. A protocol specification does not<br>
require the use of Microsoft programming tools or programming environments<br>
in order for you to develop an implementation. If you have access to<br>
Microsoft programming tools and environments you are free to take<br>
advantage of them.<br>
