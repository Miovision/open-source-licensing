Comment: The following changes were made to the upstream tarball:<br>
1.) The directory dialects/uw was removed for being non-DFSG<br>
and not needed in Debian.<br>
2.) The main source was a tarball within a tarball. Only the innermost<br>
tarball has been retained.<br>
3.) The top-level directory has been stripped away as it embedded the<br>
version number making packaging more difficult.<br>
