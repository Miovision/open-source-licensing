This is the Debian prepackaged version of the FSF's GNU m4 macro processor.<br>
GNU `m4' has been originally written by René Seindal, from Denmark,<br>
with subsequent changes by François Pinard and other volunteers on<br>
the Internet. A list of contributors to the GNU program is in the<br>
THANKS file in the source distribution, or appended below in the<br>
binary package.<br>
<br>
This package was first put together by Ian Jackson <ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu><br>
and is currently maintained by Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>.<br>
<br>
The GNU sources for this release were obtained from<br>
<br>
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.17.tar.xz<br>
<br>
The changes were very minimal - merely adding support for the Debian<br>
package maintenance scheme, by adding various debian/* files.<br>
