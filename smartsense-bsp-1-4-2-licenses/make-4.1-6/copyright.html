Comment: This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of GNU Make.  GNU Make<br>
was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath. This package was put<br>
together by Ian Murdock <imurdock@debian.org><br>
Changes:<br>
* added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files<br>
* Pared down the package to just the documentation bits, and some<br>
build infrastructure.<br>
Parts of the GNU Make build structure remain in this package.<br>
