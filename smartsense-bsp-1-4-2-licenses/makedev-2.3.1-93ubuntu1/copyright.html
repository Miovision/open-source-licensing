No explicit copyright is asserted.  Nick Holloway is the earliest author<br>

It was never explictly released as GPL, as that would have required<br>
including the file COPYING which would have been much larger than the<br>
actual MAKEDEV script (I was also too lazy to find out what incantations<br>
needed to be made).  However, it is intended to be used as anyone sees<br>
fit, and the statement under "Copying Policy" is "Freely Redistributable"<br>
(see MAKEDEV.lsm from any of the releases I made).<br>
<br>
The more recent modifications were done by Michael K. Johnson at<br>
Redhat.  I think the understanding was that he would be taking over the<br>
maintenance of MAKEDEV (our discussion took place last September).<br>
<br>
The only previous history was (according to an old posting to<br>
comp.os.linux) that I started with Jim Winstead's script.<br>
<br>
So, as far as I am concerned, it is consistentwith the Debian FSG.<br>
