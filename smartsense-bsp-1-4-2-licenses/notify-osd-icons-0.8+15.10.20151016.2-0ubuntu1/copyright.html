License<br>
<br>
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE<br>
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY<br>
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS<br>
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.<br>
<br>
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE<br>
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE<br>
CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE<br>
IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.<br>
<br>
1. Definitions<br>
<br>
1. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other<br>
pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,<br>
arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or<br>
phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other<br>
form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any<br>
form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that<br>
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose<br>
of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work,<br>
performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation<br>
with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the<br>
purpose of this License.  2. "Collection" means a collection of literary or<br>
artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,<br>
phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works<br>
listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement<br>
of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is<br>
included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other<br>
contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves,<br>
which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a<br>
Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the<br>
purposes of this License.  3. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a<br>
license that is listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that<br>
has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this<br>
License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that<br>
have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this<br>
License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works<br>
made available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons<br>
jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License.  4.<br>
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of<br>
the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of<br>
ownership.  5. "License Elements" means the following high-level license<br>
attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:<br>
Attribution, ShareAlike.  6. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals,<br>
entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.  7.<br>
"Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the<br>
individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no<br>
individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in<br>
the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other<br>
persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise<br>
perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case<br>
of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes<br>
the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of<br>
broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.  8. "Work" means the<br>
literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including<br>
without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic<br>
domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital<br>
form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or<br>
other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a<br>
choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or<br>
without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed<br>
by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,<br>
architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which<br>
are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work<br>
of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work<br>
relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a<br>
broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as<br>
a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to<br>
the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.  9.<br>
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who<br>
has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work,<br>
or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights<br>
under this License despite a previous violation.  10. "Publicly Perform" means<br>
to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public<br>
those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or<br>
wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public<br>
Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a<br>
place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the<br>
public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the<br>
performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast<br>
and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.  11.<br>
"Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without<br>
limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and<br>
reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance<br>
or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.<br>
<br>
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,<br>
or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or<br>
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection<br>
under copyright law or other applicable laws.<br>
<br>
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor<br>
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the<br>
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the<br>
Work as stated below:<br>
<br>
1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more<br>
Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; 2.<br>
to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,<br>
including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly<br>
label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original<br>
Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was<br>
translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The<br>
original work has been modified."; 3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the<br>
Work including as incorporated in Collections; and, 4. to Distribute and<br>
Publicly Perform Adaptations.  5.<br>
<br>
For the avoidance of doubt: 1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes.<br>
In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any<br>
statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor<br>
reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You<br>
of the rights granted under this License; 2. Waivable Compulsory License<br>
Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through<br>
any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives<br>
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the<br>
rights granted under this License; and, 3. Voluntary License Schemes. The<br>
Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the<br>
event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers<br>
voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the<br>
rights granted under this License.<br>
<br>
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or<br>
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such<br>
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other<br>
media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by<br>
Licensor are hereby reserved.<br>
<br>
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made<br>
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:<br>
<br>
1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of<br>
this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier<br>
(URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly<br>
Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the<br>
terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise<br>
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may<br>
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this<br>
License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You<br>
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the<br>
Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that<br>
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights<br>
granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)<br>
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require<br>
the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of<br>
this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You<br>
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as<br>
required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon<br>
notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the<br>
Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.  2. You may<br>
Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this<br>
License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as<br>
this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a<br>
later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License<br>
(e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible<br>
License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in<br>
(iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the<br>
Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or<br>
(iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of the<br>
Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include<br>
a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each<br>
Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose<br>
any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License<br>
or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights<br>
granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You<br>
must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the<br>
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the<br>
Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or<br>
Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological<br>
measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the<br>
Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the<br>
terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as<br>
incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart<br>
from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable<br>
License.  3. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations<br>
or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section<br>
4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to<br>
the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or<br>
pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or<br>
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,<br>
publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in<br>
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the<br>
name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to<br>
the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to<br>
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright<br>
notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with<br>
Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of<br>
the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original<br>
Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit<br>
required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;<br>
provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum<br>
such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the<br>
Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner<br>
at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For<br>
the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section<br>
for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising<br>
Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or<br>
imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,<br>
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the<br>
Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original<br>
Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.  4. Except as otherwise agreed in<br>
writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if<br>
You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as<br>
part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify<br>
or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be<br>
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that<br>
in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted<br>
in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed<br>
to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action<br>
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will<br>
waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent<br>
permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise<br>
Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but<br>
not otherwise.<br>
<br>
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer<br>
<br>
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS<br>
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND<br>
CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,<br>
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A<br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,<br>
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.<br>
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH<br>
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN<br>
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,<br>
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS<br>
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
7. Termination<br>
<br>
1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals<br>
or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this<br>
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such<br>
individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections<br>
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.  2. Subject<br>
to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for<br>
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the<br>
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license<br>
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any<br>
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license<br>
that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License),<br>
and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as<br>
stated above.<br>
<br>
8. Miscellaneous<br>
<br>
1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,<br>
the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms<br>
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.  2. Each time<br>
You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the<br>
recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as<br>
the license granted to You under this License.  3. If any provision of this<br>
License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect<br>
the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,<br>
and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision<br>
shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid<br>
and enforceable.  4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed<br>
waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in<br>
writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.  5.<br>
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect<br>
to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or<br>
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not<br>
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from<br>
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of<br>
the Licensor and You.  6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter<br>
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne<br>
Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on<br>
September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of<br>
1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal<br>
Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject<br>
matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are<br>
sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the<br>
implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If<br>
the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes<br>
additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are<br>
deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict<br>
the license of any rights under applicable law.<br>
