This package was debianized by Philip Hands <phil@hands.com> on 31 Oct 1999<br>
(with help from  Dan Brosemer <odin@linuxfreak.com>)<br>
<br>
It was downloaded from here:<br>
ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/unix/security/openssh/openssh-2.3.0p1.tar.gz<br>
<br>
worldwide mirrors are listed here:<br>
http://www.openssh.com/ftp.html<br>
<br>
The Debian-specific parts of the package were initially derived from the<br>
original ssh package, which has since been renamed as ssh-nonfree.<br>
<br>
The Debian patch is distributed under the terms of the GPL, which you<br>
can find in /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2.<br>
<br>
In addition, as a special exception, Matthew Vernon gives permission<br>
to link the code of the Debian patch with any version of the OpenSSH<br>
code which is distributed under a license identical to that listed in<br>
the included Copyright file, and distribute linked combinations<br>
including the two.  You must obey the GNU General Public License in<br>
all respects for all of the code used other than OpenSSH.  If you<br>
modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the<br>
file, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do<br>
so, delete this exception statement from your version.<br>
<br>
The upstream source for this package is a combination of the ssh<br>
branch that is being maintained by the OpenBSD team (starting from<br>
the last version of SSH that was distributed under a free license),<br>
and porting work by Damien Miller <damien@ibs.com.au> to get it<br>
working on Linux.  Other people also contributed to this, and are<br>
credited in /usr/share/doc/ssh/README.<br>
<br>
This package contains Kerberos version 5 patches from<br>
http://www.sxw.org.uk/computing/patches/openssh.html; this is Copyright<br>

licence used elsewhere in OpenSSH.<br>

<br>
The licences which components of this software fall under are as<br>
follows.  First, we will summarize and say that all components<br>
are under a BSD licence, or a licence more free than that.<br>
<br>
OpenSSH contains no GPL code.<br>

* Copyright (c) 1995 Tatu Ylonen <ylo@cs.hut.fi>, Espoo, Finland<br>
*                    All rights reserved<br>
*<br>
* As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software<br>
* can be used freely for any purpose.  Any derived versions of this<br>
* software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is<br>
* incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be<br>
* called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".<br>
<br>
[Tatu continues]<br>
*  However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or<br>
* copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that<br>
* are not under my direct control.  As far as I know, all included<br>
* source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements<br>
* and can be used freely for any purpose (the GNU license being the most<br>
* restrictive); see below for details.<br>
<br>
[However, none of that term is relevant at this point in time.  All of<br>
these restrictively licenced software components which he talks about<br>
have been removed from OpenSSH, i.e.,<br>
<br>
- RSA is no longer included, found in the OpenSSL library<br>
- IDEA is no longer included, its use is deprecated<br>
- DES is now external, in the OpenSSL library<br>
- GMP is no longer used, and instead we call BN code from OpenSSL<br>
- Zlib is now external, in a library<br>
- The make-ssh-known-hosts script is no longer included<br>
- TSS has been removed<br>
- MD5 is now external, in the OpenSSL library<br>
- RC4 support has been replaced with ARC4 support from OpenSSL<br>
- Blowfish is now external, in the OpenSSL library<br>
<br>
[The licence continues]<br>

software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major<br>

making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in<br>
your country, and I am not taking any responsibility on your behalf.<br>

NO WARRANTY<br>

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>

OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
