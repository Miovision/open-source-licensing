The directories ext/, dist/, and cpan/ contain separate distributions<br>
that have been bundled with the Perl core. The copyright and license<br>
status of these have been detailed separately below.<br>
.<br>
It is assumed that all the other files are part of Perl and share the<br>
above copyright and license information unless explicitly specified<br>
differently. Only the exceptions have been detailed below.<br>
.<br>
As a small portion of the files are indeed licensed differently from<br>
the above, all the other licenses have been collected and/or duplicated<br>
at the end of this file to facilitate review.<br>

Comment:<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
The first two alternative licenses, as retrieved at<br>
Thu, 09 May 2013 00:00:38 +0300<br>
are included at the end of this file.<br>
.<br>
Part of this file carries the following comment:<br>
.<br>
FYI: This is the "Super-Fast" algorithm mentioned by Bob Jenkins in<br>
(http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html)<br>
It is by Paul Hsieh (c) 2004 and is analysed here<br>
http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/hash.html<br>
license terms are here:<br>
http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/weblicense.html<br>
.<br>
As of Thu, 09 May 2013 00:02:53 +0300, the "weblicense.html" document<br>
states:<br>
.<br>
Unless otherwise accompanied by another included license, the text<br>
and explicitly rendered exposition of all content under this website<br>
is covered by the Paul Hsieh exposition license.<br>
.<br>
For the specific coverage of raw source code (only) obtained from<br>
this website, you have the option of using the old-style BSD license<br>
to use the code instead of other the licenses. This option has been<br>
provided for people who can't figure out what I talking about with my<br>
derivative license, or who are using a old-style BSD compatible license.<br>
.<br>
Unless otherwise accompanied by another included license, derivative<br>
work by taking portions or ideas from the above mentioned exposition<br>
are covered by the Paul Hsieh derivative license.<br>
.<br>
Examples: Unless covered by another accompanying license, source code<br>
shown on my website can be used freely under the derivative license,<br>
(and may be distributed under a public domain license, whether compiled<br>
into another program or not, for example) however the font, comments,<br>
colors or any layout details associated to that source code in its<br>
exposition are covered by the exposition license.<br>
.<br>
The entire English text describing the code is also covered under the<br>
exposition license and thus cannot be copied at all outside the limits<br>
of fair use.<br>
.<br>
Images and graphics shown on this website are entirely covered by the<br>
exposition license.<br>
.<br>
If a proprietary vendor wishes to create a closed source object code<br>
based product using source covered by the derivative license they may<br>
do so. However if this vendor then wished to distribute the original<br>
source code, they may not apply any licensing terms which contradict<br>
the original derivative license covering the derivative code.<br>
.<br>
If your code is compatible with the old style BSD license and you<br>
wish to avoid the burden of explicitely protecting code you obtained<br>
from here from misrepresentation then you can simply cover it with<br>
the old-style BSD license.<br>
.<br>
It is therefore assumed that the relevant part of the Perl source<br>
is licensed under either the "Paul Hsieh derivative license" or<br>
the "the old-style BSD license", which have been included at<br>
the end of file with the codenames HSIEH-DERIVATIVE and HSIEH-BSD.<br>
.<br>
Additionally, the "hash.html" document has this statement for the<br>
relevant source code:<br>
.<br>
IMPORTANT NOTE: Since there has been a lot of interest for the code<br>
below, I have decided to additionally provide it under the LGPL 2.1<br>
license. This provision applies to the code below only and not to any<br>
other code including other source archives or listings from this site<br>
unless otherwise specified.<br>
.<br>
The LGPL 2.1 is not necessarily a more liberal license than my<br>
derivative license, but this additional licensing makes the code<br>
available to more developers. Note that this does not give you<br>
multi-licensing rights. You can only use the code under one of the<br>
licenses at a time.<br>

Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.<br>
.<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this<br>
license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
.<br>
Preamble<br>
.<br>
This license establishes the terms under which a given free software<br>
Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.<br>
The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic<br>
control over the development of that Package while still keeping the<br>
Package available as open source and free software.<br>
.<br>
You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this<br>
license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the<br>
terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to<br>
make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek<br>
a different licensing arrangement.<br>
.<br>
Definitions<br>
.<br>
"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in<br>
the copyright notice for the entire Package.<br>
.<br>
"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other<br>
material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's<br>
procedures.<br>
.<br>
"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,<br>
or modify the Package.<br>
.<br>
"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright<br>
Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A<br>
given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a<br>
Modified Version.<br>
.<br>
"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it<br>
accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or<br>
organization, to others outside of your company or organization.<br>
.<br>
"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this<br>
Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It<br>
does not mean licensing fees.<br>
.<br>
"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,<br>
or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the<br>
Copyright Holder.<br>
.<br>
"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such<br>
changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.<br>
.<br>
"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the<br>
Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may<br>
be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.<br>
.<br>
"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and<br>
configuration files for the Package.<br>
.<br>
"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or<br>
any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation<br>
of the Source form.<br>
.<br>
Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution<br>
.<br>
(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use<br>
Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that<br>
you do not Distribute the Modified Version.<br>
.<br>
Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version<br>
.<br>
(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the<br>
Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,<br>
either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate<br>
all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At<br>
your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a<br>
Compiled form of the Package.<br>
.<br>
(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other<br>
modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting<br>
Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such<br>
will be subject to the Original License.<br>
.<br>
Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source<br>
.<br>
(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis<br>
or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the<br>
Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs<br>
from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting<br>
any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that<br>
you do at least ONE of the following:<br>
.<br>
(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the<br>
Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright<br>
Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. (b)<br>
ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the<br>
user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the<br>
Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of<br>
the Standard Version. (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the<br>
Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version<br>
available to others under (i) the Original License or (ii) a license<br>
that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the<br>
Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy<br>
that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the<br>
Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely<br>
available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are<br>
allowed.<br>
.<br>
Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified<br>
Versions without the Source<br>
.<br>
(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without<br>
the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to<br>
get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be<br>
valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any<br>
time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you<br>
must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.<br>
If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty<br>
days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then<br>
you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.<br>
.<br>
(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the<br>
Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the<br>
Source of the Modified Version.<br>
.<br>
Aggregating or Linking the Package<br>
.<br>
(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or<br>
Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting<br>
aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the<br>
Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other<br>
components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license<br>
apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions<br>
as included in the aggregation.<br>
.<br>
(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with<br>
other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to<br>
build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that<br>
include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,<br>
provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.<br>
.<br>
Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version<br>
.<br>
(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that<br>
merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause<br>
the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not<br>
considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the<br>
terms of this license.<br>
.<br>
General Provisions<br>
.<br>
(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or<br>
Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,<br>
modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not<br>
use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this<br>
license.<br>
.<br>
(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version<br>
made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to<br>
ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of<br>
this license.<br>
.<br>
(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,<br>
service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.<br>
.<br>
(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,<br>
free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,<br>
sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any<br>
patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily<br>
infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging<br>
that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent<br>
infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the<br>
date that such litigation is filed.<br>
.<br>

HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED<br>
WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A<br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT<br>

<br>
License:  CC0-1.0<br>
Statatement of Purpose<br>
.<br>
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer<br>
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator<br>
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work<br>
of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").<br>
.<br>
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work<br>
for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and<br>
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without<br>
fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in<br>
other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form<br>
whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial<br>
purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal<br>
of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and<br>
scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for<br>
their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.<br>
.<br>
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any<br>
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person<br>
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that<br>
he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,<br>
voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute<br>
the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and<br>
Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect<br>
of CC0 on those rights.<br>
.<br>
1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be<br>
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright<br>
and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are<br>
not limited to, the following:<br>
.<br>
the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,<br>
communicate, and translate a Work;<br>
.<br>
moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);<br>
.<br>
publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or<br>
likeness depicted in a Work;<br>
.<br>
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,<br>
subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;<br>
.<br>
rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;<br>
.<br>
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC<br>
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996<br>
on the legal protection of databases, and under any national<br>
implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version<br>
of such directive); and<br>
.<br>
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world<br>
based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations<br>
thereof.<br>
.<br>
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention<br>
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,<br>
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all<br>
of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and<br>
causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing<br>
as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in<br>
all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by<br>
applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)<br>
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)<br>
for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,<br>
advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the<br>
Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the<br>
detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such<br>
Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,<br>
termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the<br>
quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's<br>
express Statement of Purpose.<br>
.<br>
3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any<br>
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,<br>
then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted<br>
taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In<br>
addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby<br>
grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non<br>
sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license<br>
to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i)<br>
in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided<br>
by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)<br>
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)<br>
for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,<br>
advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall<br>
be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the<br>
Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally<br>
invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity<br>
or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,<br>
and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)<br>
exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in<br>
the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action<br>
with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express<br>
Statement of Purpose.<br>
.<br>
4. Limitations and Disclaimers.<br>
.<br>
No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,<br>
abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this<br>
document.<br>
.<br>
Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or<br>
warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,<br>
statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties<br>
of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non<br>
infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,<br>
or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,<br>
all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.<br>
.<br>
Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other<br>
persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including<br>
without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the<br>
Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any<br>
necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any<br>
use of the Work.<br>
.<br>
Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not<br>
a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect<br>
to this CC0 or use of the Work.<br>
