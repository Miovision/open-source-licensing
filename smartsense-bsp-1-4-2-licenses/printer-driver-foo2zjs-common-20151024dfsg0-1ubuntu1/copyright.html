This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation, version 2 of the License.<br>
.<br>
The full text of the GPL is distributed as in<br>
/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2 on Debian systems.<br>
.<br>
In addition, as the copyright holder of CUPS, Apple Inc. grants<br>
the following special exceptions:<br>
.<br>
1. Apple Operating System Development License Exception;<br>
.<br>
a. Software that is developed by any person or entity<br>
for an Apple Operating System ("Apple OS-Developed<br>
Software"), including but not limited to Apple and<br>
third party printer drivers, filters, and backends<br>
for an Apple Operating System, that is linked to the<br>
CUPS imaging library or based on any sample filters<br>
or backends provided with CUPS shall not be<br>
considered to be a derivative work or collective work<br>
based on the CUPS program and is exempt from the<br>
mandatory source code release clauses of the GNU GPL.<br>
You may therefore distribute linked combinations of<br>
the CUPS imaging library with Apple OS-Developed<br>
Software without releasing the source code of the<br>
Apple OS-Developed Software. You may also use sample<br>
filters and backends provided with CUPS to develop<br>
Apple OS-Developed Software without releasing the<br>
source code of the Apple OS-Developed Software.<br>
.<br>
b. An Apple Operating System means any operating system<br>
software developed and/or marketed by Apple Computer,<br>
Inc., including but not limited to all existing<br>
releases and versions of Apple's Darwin, Mac OS X,<br>
and Mac OS X Server products and all follow-on<br>
releases and future versions thereof.<br>
.<br>
c. This exception is only available for Apple<br>
OS-Developed Software and does not apply to software<br>
that is distributed for use on other operating<br>
systems.<br>
.<br>
d. All CUPS software that falls under this license<br>
exception have the following text at the top of each<br>
source file:<br>
.<br>
This file is subject to the Apple OS-Developed<br>
Software exception.<br>
.<br>
2. OpenSSL Toolkit License Exception;<br>
.<br>
a. Apple Inc. explicitly allows the compilation and<br>
distribution of the CUPS software with the OpenSSL<br>
Toolkit.<br>
.<br>
No developer is required to provide these exceptions in a<br>
derived work.<br>
