Upstream-Name: pxljr<br>
Source: http://hp-pxl-jetready.sourceforge.net/<br>
The original tarball (as imported from Ubuntu) was in fact the<br>
pxljr-1.3_wlibjpeg.tar.gz, that embeds libjpeg6b.<br>
.<br>
This tarball has been repacked to remove the libjpeg6b and the libijs source<br>
files that were included. While the code from both libraries is free software<br>
and could be shipped in this source tarball, it was found more convenient to<br>
make sure the actual files don't appear in the tarball and thus cannot be<br>
used in the building process.<br>

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,<br>
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.<br>
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead<br>
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,<br>
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file<br>
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part<br>
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than<br>
the foregoing paragraphs do.<br>
.<br>
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.<br>
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.<br>
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,<br>
ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium<br>
but is also freely distributable.<br>
.<br>
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.<br>
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has<br>
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce<br>
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the<br>
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard<br>
GIF decoders.<br>
.<br>
We are required to state that<br>
"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of<br>
