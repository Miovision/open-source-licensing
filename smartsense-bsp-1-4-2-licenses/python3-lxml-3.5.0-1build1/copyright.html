Some code, such a selftest.py, selftest2.py and<br>
src/lxml/_elementpath.py are derived from ElementTree and<br>
cElementTree. See doc/licenses/elementtree.txt for the license text.<br>
<br>
test.py, the test-runner script, is GPL and copyright Shuttleworth<br>
Foundation. See doc/licenses/GPL.txt. It is believed the unchanged<br>
inclusion of test.py to run the unit test suite falls under the<br>
"aggregation" clause of the GPL and thus does not affect the license<br>
of the rest of the package.<br>
<br>
the doctest.py module is taken from the Python library and falls under<br>
the PSF Python License.<br>
