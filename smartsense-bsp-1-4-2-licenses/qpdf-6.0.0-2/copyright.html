<br>
Artistic License 2.0<br>
<br>
Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this<br>
license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
This license establishes the terms under which a given free software<br>
Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or<br>
redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some<br>
artistic control over the development of that Package while still<br>
keeping the Package available as open source and free software.<br>
<br>
You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this<br>
license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the<br>
terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to<br>
make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek<br>
a different licensing arrangement.<br>
<br>
Definitions<br>
<br>
"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named<br>
in the copyright notice for the entire Package.<br>
<br>
"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other<br>
material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's<br>
procedures.<br>
<br>
"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,<br>
distribute, or modify the Package.<br>
<br>
"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the<br>
Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of<br>
those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard<br>
Version, or a Modified Version.<br>
<br>
"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it<br>
accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or<br>
organization, to others outside of your company or organization.<br>
<br>
"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing<br>
this Package or providing support for this Package to another<br>
party. It does not mean licensing fees.<br>
<br>
"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been<br>
modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by<br>
the Copyright Holder.<br>
<br>
"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and<br>
such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.<br>
<br>
"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with<br>
the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as<br>
it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.<br>
<br>
"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and<br>
configuration files for the Package.<br>
<br>
"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,<br>
or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or<br>
translation of the Source form.<br>
<br>
Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution<br>
<br>
(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use<br>
Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that<br>
you do not Distribute the Modified Version.<br>
<br>
Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version<br>
<br>
(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the<br>
Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,<br>
either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate<br>
all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At<br>
your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a<br>
Compiled form of the Package.<br>
<br>
(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other<br>
modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting<br>
Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such<br>
will be subject to the Original License.<br>
<br>
Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source<br>
<br>
(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis<br>
or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the<br>
Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs<br>
from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting<br>
any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that<br>
you do at least ONE of the following:<br>
<br>
(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of<br>
the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the<br>
Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard<br>
Version.<br>
<br>
(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not<br>
prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In<br>
addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different<br>
from the name of the Standard Version.<br>
<br>
(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to<br>
make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others<br>
under<br>
<br>
(i) the Original License or<br>
<br>
(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify<br>
and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing<br>
terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and<br>
requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of<br>
any works derived from it, be made freely available in that<br>
license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.<br>
Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or<br>
Modified Versions without the Source<br>
<br>
(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without<br>
the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to<br>
get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be<br>
valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any<br>
time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you<br>
must provide new instructions on demand or cease further<br>
distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution<br>
within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are<br>
invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this<br>
license.<br>
<br>
(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the<br>
Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the<br>
Source of the Modified Version.<br>
<br>
Aggregating or Linking the Package<br>
<br>
(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or<br>
Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting<br>
aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the<br>
Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other<br>
components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license<br>
apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions<br>
as included in the aggregation.<br>
<br>
(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with<br>
other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to<br>
build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that<br>
include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,<br>
provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.<br>
<br>
Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version<br>
<br>
(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that<br>
merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause<br>
the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not<br>
considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the<br>
terms of this license.<br>
<br>
General Provisions<br>
<br>
(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or<br>
Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,<br>
modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not<br>
use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this<br>
license.<br>
<br>
(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version<br>
made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to<br>
ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of<br>
this license.<br>
<br>
(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,<br>
service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.<br>
<br>
(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,<br>
free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,<br>
sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any<br>
patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily<br>
infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging<br>
that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent<br>
infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the<br>
date that such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED<br>
WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A<br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT<br>

HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,<br>
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE<br>
OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.<br>
