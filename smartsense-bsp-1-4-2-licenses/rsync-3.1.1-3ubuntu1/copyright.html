This is Debian's prepackaged version of Andrew Tridgell and<br>
Paul Mackerras' rsync utility.<br>
<br>
This package provides the rsync program, which is a replacement<br>
for rcp that uses the rsync algorythm to transfer only the<br>
differences between two sets of files.<br>
<br>
This package was put together by Philip Hands <phil@hands.com>,<br>
from sources obtained from:<br>
http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsync-2.5.4.tar.gz<br>
The current version was downloaded from:<br>
http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/src/rsync-3.1.0.tar.gz<br>
on 2013-09-30 by Paul Slootman <paul@debian.org> .<br>
<br>
The changes were very minimal - merely adding support for the Debian<br>
package maintenance scheme by adding various debian/* files.<br>
The only significant change is passing the -4 / -6 options through to ssh.<br>
See the debian/patches/ directory.<br>
