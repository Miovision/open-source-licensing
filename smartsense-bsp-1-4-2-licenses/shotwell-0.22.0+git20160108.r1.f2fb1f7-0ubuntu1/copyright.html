License: CC-BY-SA-3.0<br>
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS<br>
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS<br>
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE<br>
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS<br>
PROHIBITED.<br>
.<br>
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND<br>
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS<br>
LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU<br>
THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.<br>
.<br>
1. Definitions<br>
.<br>
1. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and<br>
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative<br>
work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic<br>
work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations<br>
or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted<br>
including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a<br>
work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for<br>
the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is<br>
a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work<br>
in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an<br>
Adaptation for the purpose of this License.<br>
.<br>
2. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as<br>
encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,<br>
or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)<br>
below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,<br>
constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its<br>
entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions,<br>
each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which<br>
together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a<br>
Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the<br>
purposes of this License.<br>
.<br>
3. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at<br>
http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by<br>
Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License, including,<br>
at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the same<br>
purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and,<br>
(ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made<br>
available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons<br>
jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License.<br>
.<br>
4. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and<br>
copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other<br>
transfer of ownership.<br>
.<br>

as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:<br>
Attribution, ShareAlike.<br>

offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.<br>

7. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,<br>

if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in<br>
addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians,<br>
dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in,<br>
interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions<br>
of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person<br>
or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other<br>
sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that<br>
transmits the broadcast.<br>
.<br>
8. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the<br>
terms of this License including without limitation any production in<br>
the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode<br>
or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,<br>
pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other<br>
work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a<br>
choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition<br>
with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated<br>
works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of<br>
drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a<br>
photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a<br>
process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration,<br>
map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography,<br>
topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a<br>
phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a<br>
copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer<br>
to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.<br>
.<br>
9. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this<br>
License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with<br>
respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the<br>
Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous<br>
violation.<br>
.<br>
10. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work<br>
and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means<br>
or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital<br>
performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that<br>
members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place<br>
individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any<br>
means or process and the communication to the public of the performances<br>
of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and<br>
rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.<br>
.<br>
11. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including<br>
without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of<br>
fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of<br>
a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic<br>
medium.<br>
.<br>
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,<br>
limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from<br>
limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the<br>
copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.<br>
.<br>
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,<br>
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,<br>
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to<br>
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:<br>
.<br>
1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more<br>
Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;<br>
2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,<br>
including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to<br>
clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to<br>
the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The<br>
original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification<br>
could indicate "The original work has been modified.";<br>
3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated<br>
in Collections; and,<br>
4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.<br>
5. For the avoidance of doubt:<br>
1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions<br>
in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br>
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves<br>
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You<br>
of the rights granted under this License;<br>
2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br>
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory<br>
licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right<br>
to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted<br>
under this License; and,<br>
3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to<br>
collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor<br>
is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing<br>
schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted<br>
under this License.<br>
.<br>
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now<br>
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make<br>
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights<br>
in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not<br>
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.<br>
.<br>
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly<br>
made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:<br>
.<br>
1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms<br>
of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource<br>
Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You<br>
Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on<br>
the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the<br>
recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient<br>
under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must<br>
keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of<br>
warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.<br>
When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any<br>
effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a<br>
recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that<br>
recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the<br>
Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the<br>
Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of<br>
this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You<br>
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as<br>
required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon<br>
notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from<br>
the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.<br>
.<br>
2. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the<br>
terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the<br>
same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons<br>
jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains<br>
the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike<br>
3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the<br>
Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply<br>
with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the<br>
terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the<br>
"Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable<br>
License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a<br>
copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each<br>
Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or<br>
impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the<br>
Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to<br>
exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the<br>
Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to<br>
the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy<br>
of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly<br>
Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You<br>
may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that<br>
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise<br>
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable<br>
License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a<br>
Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the<br>
Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable<br>
License.<br>
.<br>
3. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or<br>
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section<br>
4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,<br>
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the<br>
Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the<br>
Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,<br>
a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution<br>
("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service<br>
or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the<br>
title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable,<br>
the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,<br>
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing<br>
information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the<br>
case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the<br>
Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or<br>
"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit<br>
required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;<br>
provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a<br>
minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors<br>
of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and<br>
in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing<br>
authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by<br>
this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,<br>
by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or<br>
explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement<br>
by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as<br>
appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express<br>
prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or<br>
Attribution Parties.<br>
.<br>
4. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be<br>
otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or<br>
Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations<br>
or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other<br>
derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to<br>
the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those<br>
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in<br>
Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be<br>
deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory<br>
action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the<br>
Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the<br>
fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to<br>
reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right<br>
to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.<br>
.<br>
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer<br>
.<br>
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR<br>
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY<br>
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,<br>
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,<br>
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF<br>
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,<br>
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br>
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
.<br>
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE<br>
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR<br>
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES<br>
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS<br>
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
.<br>
7. Termination<br>
.<br>
1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.<br>
Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections<br>
from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses<br>
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full<br>
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will<br>
survive any termination of this License.<br>
2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted<br>
here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in<br>
the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to<br>
release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing<br>
the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will<br>
not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been,<br>
or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this<br>
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated<br>
above.<br>
.<br>
8. Miscellaneous<br>
.<br>
1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,<br>
the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same<br>
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.<br>
2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor<br>
offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms<br>
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.<br>
3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under<br>
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of<br>
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action<br>
by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to<br>
the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br>
4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no<br>
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing<br>
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.<br>
5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties<br>
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,<br>
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified<br>
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that<br>
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be<br>
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.<br>
6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this<br>
License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention<br>
for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on<br>
September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright<br>
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996<br>
and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).<br>
These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction<br>
in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the<br>
corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty<br>
provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of<br>
rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights<br>
not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be<br>
included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the<br>
license of any rights under applicable law.<br>
.<br>
Creative Commons Notice<br>
.<br>
Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty<br>
whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be<br>
liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever,<br>
vincluding without limitation any general, special, incidental or<br>
consequential damages arising in connection to this license.<br>
Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has<br>
expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all<br>
rights and obligations of Licensor.<br>
.<br>
Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the<br>
Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize<br>
the use by either party of the trademark "Creative Commons" or any<br>
related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written<br>
consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance<br>
with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may<br>
be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request<br>
from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, this trademark restriction<br>
does not form part of this License.<br>
