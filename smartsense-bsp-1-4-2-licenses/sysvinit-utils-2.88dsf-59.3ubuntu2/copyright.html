This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of System V Init.<br>
<br>
Init was written by Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>.<br>
<br>
This package was first put together by Bruce Perens <Bruce@Pixar.com><br>
from pre-distribution sources. Ian Murdock <imurdock@debian.org><br>
integrated it into the base system maintained it until the end of 1995.<br>
Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl> implemented Debian support.<br>
In version 2.85 the package was split into three (sysvinit, sysv-rc,<br>
and initscripts) in order to make room for alternative rc mechanisms.<br>
