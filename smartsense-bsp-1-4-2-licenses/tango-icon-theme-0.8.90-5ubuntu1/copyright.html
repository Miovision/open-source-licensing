In the preparation of the 0.8.90 release Novell took care of tracking<br>
down all the contributors to get them to relicense their artwork<br>
into Public Domain.<br>
<br>
The COPYING file of the tarball states the following:<br>

<br>
Additionally the copyright status of the files was tracked in the CVS and the<br>
rdf properties of the SVGs adjusted for all files that were put into Public<br>
Domain (see rdf:about and rdf:resource).  Both fields contain a link to the<br>
Creative Commons Public Domain Dediciation[0] as reproduced below:<br>
