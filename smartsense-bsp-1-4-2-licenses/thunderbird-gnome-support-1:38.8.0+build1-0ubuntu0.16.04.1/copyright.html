This package was debianized by Fabien Tassin <fta@sofaraway.org> on 2008-02-25<br>
<br>
The package was downloaded from http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/thunderbird/<br>
<br>
EDIT: downloaded from CVS (until 3.0 is released) using the following commands:<br>
debian/rules get-orig-source (you need to install mozilla-devscripts >= 0.05)<br>
<br>
The source tarball is an aggregate of several different works in which the<br>
main one, developed by the Mozilla Project, is thunderbird.<br>
<br>
The contents of the debian directory are licensed like the bulk of<br>
thunderbird, tri-licensed under the GPL/LGPL/MPL.<br>
<br>
Other works include gzip, bzip2, sqlite, libjpeg, libpng, cairo, and others.<br>
Please see the sections following the copyright statements for thunderbird for<br>
these.<br>
<br>
If this file is incomplete, which I'm pretty sure is the case, because it's<br>
difficult not to forget anything in this huge amount of data, please file<br>
a bug or contact me.<br>

Overall, the thunderbird project is licensed under the terms of the Mozilla<br>

On Debian systems, the complete text of the GNU General Public<br>

The complete text of the Mozilla Public License can be found in the MPL file<br>
in the same directory as this file.<br>
<br>
Some of the files are also licensed (single, dual or tri) under the terms of<br>
the Netscape Public License (NPL) which can be found as amendments to the<br>
MPL at the end of the file. Please refer to http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/relicensing-faq.html<br>
<br>
While the Mozilla Project is undergoing a global relicensing so that the<br>
aim is to have a full tree with these tri-license terms, there are at the<br>
moment quite some exceptions as following:<br>
<br>
(Note that I sometimes assumed files not explicitely licensed to be licensed<br>
under the same terms as the files around them and that a lot of the<br>
information has been extracted automatically, thus maybe leaving some doubt.<br>
Again, if you find "bugs", please contact me by email or via the BTS.)<br>
