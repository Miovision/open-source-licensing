UBUNTU FONT LICENCE Version 1.0<br>
-------------------------------<br>
.<br>
PREAMBLE<br>
This licence allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br>
redistributed freely. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be<br>
bundled, embedded, and redistributed provided the terms of this licence<br>
are met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under<br>
any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this<br>
licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their<br>
derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary<br>
purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of<br>
the fonts.<br>
.<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright<br>
Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may<br>
include source files, build scripts and documentation.<br>
.<br>
"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components<br>
as received under this licence.<br>
.<br>
"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,<br>
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the<br>
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to<br>
a new environment.<br>
.<br>
"Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a<br>
copyright ownership of the Font Software.<br>
.<br>
"Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily<br>
identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font<br>
Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.<br>
.<br>
To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging<br>
a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some<br>
countries other activities as well.<br>
.<br>
PERMISSION & CONDITIONS<br>
This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such<br>
rights are reserved.<br>
.<br>
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a<br>
copy of the Font Software, to propagate the Font Software, subject to<br>
the below conditions:<br>
.<br>
1) Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright<br>
notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone<br>
text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-<br>
readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those<br>
fields can be easily viewed by the user.<br>
.<br>
2) The font name complies with the following:<br>
(a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.<br>
(b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to<br>
avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.<br>
(c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be<br>
renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add<br>
additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the<br>
Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of<br>
the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of<br>
the new work, appended to that name.<br>
.<br>
3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the<br>
Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any<br>
Modified Version, except (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to<br>
acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or (iii) with<br>
their explicit written permission.<br>
.<br>
4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must<br>
be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed<br>
under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this<br>
licence does not affect any document created using the Font Software,<br>
except any version of the Font Software extracted from a document<br>
created using the Font Software may only be distributed under this<br>
licence.<br>
.<br>
TERMINATION<br>
This licence becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are<br>
not met.<br>
.<br>
DISCLAIMER<br>
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,<br>
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF<br>

COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL<br>
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING<br>
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER<br>
DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.<br>
