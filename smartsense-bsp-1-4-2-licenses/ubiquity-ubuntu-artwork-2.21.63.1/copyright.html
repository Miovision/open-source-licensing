Ubiquity was formerly known as "Espresso", and originally as "Ubuntu<br>
Express", which is written and maintained by Javier Carranza<br>
<javier.carranza@interactors.coop> and Juanje Ojeda Croissier<br>
<juanje@interactors.coop>. This version draws on the work done on Ubuntu<br>
Express, but was renamed to avoid confusion, to reduce awkward branding<br>
considerations, and because Ubiquity concentrates on reusing<br>
debian-installer code and reducing duplicated translation and branding work<br>
as much as possible. Ubiquity has now substantially diverged from Ubuntu<br>
Express and is an independent project.<br>
