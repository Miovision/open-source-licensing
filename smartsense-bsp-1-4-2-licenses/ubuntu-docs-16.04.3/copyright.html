THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE<br>
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY<br>
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS<br>
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.<br>
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE<br>
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE<br>
CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE<br>
IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.<br>
1. Definitions<br>
a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other<br>
pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,<br>
arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work,<br>
or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or<br>
any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted<br>
including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that<br>
a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation<br>
for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the<br>
Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of<br>
the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be<br>
considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.<br>
b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as<br>
encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,<br>
or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)<br>
below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their<br>
contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is<br>
included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other<br>
contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in<br>
themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work<br>
that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as<br>
defined below) for the purposes of this License.<br>
c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at<br>
http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by<br>
Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License,<br>
including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that<br>
have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this<br>
License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of<br>
works made available under that license under this License or a Creative<br>
Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this<br>
License.<br>
d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and<br>
copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other<br>
transfer of ownership.<br>
e. "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as<br>
selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:<br>
Attribution, ShareAlike.<br>
f. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that<br>
offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.<br>
g. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the<br>
individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no<br>
individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition<br>
(i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers,<br>
and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or<br>
otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;<br>
(ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal<br>
entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,<br>
(iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the<br>
broadcast.<br>
h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of<br>
this License including without limitation any production in the literary,<br>
scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its<br>
expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other<br>
writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a<br>
dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment<br>
in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a<br>
cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a<br>
process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,<br>
architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to<br>
which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to<br>
photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or<br>
three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or<br>
science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data<br>
to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work<br>
performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not<br>
otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.<br>
i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License<br>
who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to<br>
the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to<br>
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.<br>
j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to<br>
communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or<br>
process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital<br>
performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that<br>
members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place<br>
individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any<br>
means or process and the communication to the public of the performances<br>
of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and<br>
rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.<br>
k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including<br>
without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of<br>
fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a<br>
protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic<br>
medium.<br>
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,<br>
or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or<br>
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection<br>
under copyright law or other applicable laws.<br>
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor<br>
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the<br>
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the<br>
Work as stated below:<br>
a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more<br>
Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the<br>
Collections;<br>
b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,<br>
including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to<br>
clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to<br>
the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The<br>
original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification<br>
could indicate "The original work has been modified.";<br>
c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in<br>
Collections; and,<br>
d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.<br>
e. For the avoidance of doubt:<br>
i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br>
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br>
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves<br>
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by<br>
You of the rights granted under this License;<br>
ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br>
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br>
compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the<br>
exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You<br>
of the rights granted under this License; and,<br>
iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect<br>
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor<br>
is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary<br>
licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of<br>
the rights granted under this License.<br>
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or<br>
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such<br>
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other<br>
media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by<br>
Licensor are hereby reserved.<br>
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made<br>
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:<br>
a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of<br>
this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource<br>
Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You<br>
Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on<br>
the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the<br>
recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient<br>
under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must<br>
keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer<br>
of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly<br>
Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not<br>
impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the<br>
ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights<br>
granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4<br>
(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does<br>
not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject<br>
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice<br>
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the<br>
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You<br>
create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the<br>
extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by<br>
Section 4(c), as requested.<br>
b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms<br>
of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same<br>
License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction<br>
license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same<br>
License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US));<br>
(iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation<br>
under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the<br>
terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of<br>
any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable<br>
License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License<br>
generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of,<br>
or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation<br>
You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any<br>
terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License<br>
or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights<br>
granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License;<br>
(III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable<br>
License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work<br>
as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV)<br>
when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not<br>
impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that<br>
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to<br>
exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the<br>
Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as<br>
incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection<br>
apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the<br>
Applicable License.<br>
c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or<br>
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section<br>
4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,<br>
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the<br>
Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the<br>
Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,<br>
a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution<br>
("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service<br>
or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the<br>
title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably<br>
practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated<br>
with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or<br>
licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3<br>
(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the<br>
Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original<br>
Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The<br>
credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable<br>
manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or<br>
Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all<br>
contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as<br>
part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the<br>
credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt,<br>
You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of<br>
attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights<br>
under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply<br>
any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,<br>
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use<br>
of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of<br>
the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.<br>
d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be<br>
otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or<br>
Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations<br>
or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other<br>
derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to<br>
the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those<br>
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in<br>
Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be<br>
deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory<br>
action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the<br>
Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the<br>
fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to<br>
reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right<br>
to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.<br>
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer<br>
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS<br>
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND<br>
CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,<br>
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A<br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,<br>
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.<br>
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH<br>
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN<br>
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,<br>
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS<br>
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
7. Termination<br>
a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.<br>
Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from<br>
You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated<br>
provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with<br>
those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any<br>
termination of this License.<br>
b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is<br>
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).<br>
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the<br>
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at<br>
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to<br>
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required<br>
to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will<br>
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.<br>
8. Miscellaneous<br>
a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,<br>
the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same<br>
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.<br>
b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor<br>
offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms<br>
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.<br>
c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under<br>
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the<br>
remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the<br>
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the<br>
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br>
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach<br>
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed<br>
by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.<br>
e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with<br>
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,<br>
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified<br>
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may<br>
appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified<br>
without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.<br>
f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this<br>
License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention<br>
for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on<br>
September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright<br>
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and<br>
the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These<br>
rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in<br>
which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the<br>
corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions<br>
in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted<br>
under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted<br>
under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in<br>
the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any<br>
rights under applicable law.<br>
