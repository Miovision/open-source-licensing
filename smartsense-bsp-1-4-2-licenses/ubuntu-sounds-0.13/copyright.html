<br>
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE<br>
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY<br>
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS<br>
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.<br>
<br>
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE<br>
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE<br>
RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS<br>
AND CONDITIONS.<br>
<br>
1. Definitions<br>
<br>
a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,<br>
anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in<br>
unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,<br>
constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled<br>
into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will<br>
not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes<br>
of this License.<br>
b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the<br>
Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical<br>
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,<br>
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any<br>
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,<br>
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be<br>
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the<br>
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound<br>
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a<br>
moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the<br>
purpose of this License.<br>
c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work<br>
under the terms of this License.<br>
d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the<br>
Work.<br>
e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under<br>
the terms of this License.<br>
f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this<br>
License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with<br>
respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the<br>
Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous<br>
violation.<br>
g. "License Elements" means the following high-level license<br>
attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this<br>
License: Attribution, ShareAlike.<br>
<br>
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,<br>
limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other<br>
limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under<br>
copyright law or other applicable laws.<br>
<br>
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,<br>
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,<br>
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to<br>
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:<br>
<br>
a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more<br>
Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the<br>
Collective Works;<br>
b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;<br>
c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform<br>
publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission<br>
the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;<br>
d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform<br>
publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission<br>
Derivative Works.<br>
e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical<br>
composition:<br>
i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor<br>
waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a<br>
performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for<br>
the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)<br>
of the Work.<br>
ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives<br>
the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music<br>
rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),<br>
royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover<br>
version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created<br>
by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in<br>
other jurisdictions).<br>
f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of<br>
doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the<br>
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a<br>
performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the<br>
public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the<br>
compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act<br>
(or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).<br>
<br>
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now<br>
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make<br>
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights<br>
in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor<br>
are hereby reserved.<br>
<br>
4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made<br>
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:<br>
<br>
a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or<br>
publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this<br>
License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource<br>
Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work<br>
You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly<br>
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work<br>
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'<br>
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the<br>
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to<br>
the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,<br>
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any<br>
technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a<br>
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above<br>
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does<br>
not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made<br>
subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work,<br>
upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,<br>
remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the<br>
Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon<br>
notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove<br>
from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original<br>
Author, as requested.<br>
b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or<br>
publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of<br>
this License, a later version of this License with the same License<br>
Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that<br>
contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.<br>
Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the<br>
Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other license specified<br>
in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each<br>
Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or<br>
publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the<br>
Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the<br>
recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep<br>
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of<br>
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,<br>
or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological<br>
measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent<br>
with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the<br>
Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not<br>
require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be<br>
made subject to the terms of this License.<br>
c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly<br>
digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works,<br>
You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the<br>
Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are<br>
utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the<br>
Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the<br>
extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any,<br>
that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI<br>
does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the<br>
Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use<br>
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the<br>
Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by<br>
Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable<br>
manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or<br>
Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other<br>
comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as<br>
prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.<br>
<br>
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer<br>
UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS<br>
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND<br>
CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,<br>
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,<br>
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF<br>
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,<br>
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br>
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE<br>
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR<br>
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES<br>
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS<br>
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
7. Termination<br>
<br>
a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.<br>
Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective<br>
Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses<br>
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full<br>
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will<br>
survive any termination of this License.<br>
b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted<br>
here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the<br>
Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release<br>
the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work<br>
at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to<br>
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is<br>
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this<br>
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as<br>
stated above.<br>
<br>
8. Miscellaneous<br>
<br>
a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or<br>
a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the<br>
Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You<br>
under this License.<br>
b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a<br>
Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the<br>
original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to<br>
You under this License.<br>
c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under<br>
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of<br>
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action<br>
by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to<br>
the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and<br>
enforceable.<br>
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no<br>
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing<br>
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.<br>
e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties<br>
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,<br>
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified<br>
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may<br>
appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified<br>
without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.<br>
