hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license<br>
.<br>
(a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or<br>
trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,<br>
display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications<br>
created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an<br>
unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code<br>
and/or as part of a Larger Work; and<br>
.<br>
(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or<br>
selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone<br>
and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions<br>
of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have<br>
made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that<br>
Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of<br>
Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor<br>
Version (or portions of such combination).<br>
.<br>
(c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are<br>
effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of<br>
the Covered Code.<br>
(d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is<br>
granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the<br>
Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;<br>
3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of<br>
Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made<br>
by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the<br>
Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims<br>
infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by<br>
that Contributor.<br>
.<br>
3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
.<br>
3.1. Application of License.<br>
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are<br>
governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation<br>
Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be<br>
distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version<br>
of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a<br>
copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You<br>
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code<br>
version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this<br>
License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include<br>
an additional document offering the additional rights described in<br>
Section 3.5.<br>
.<br>
3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br>
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be<br>
made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License<br>
either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted<br>
Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an<br>
Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic<br>
Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)<br>
months after the date it initially became available, or at least six<br>
(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification<br>
has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for<br>
ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the<br>
Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<br>
.<br>
3.3. Description of Modifications.<br>
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a<br>
file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and<br>
the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that<br>
the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original<br>
Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the<br>
Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an<br>
Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the<br>
origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br>
.<br>
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br>
(a) Third Party Claims.<br>
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's<br>
intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights<br>
granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,<br>
Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code<br>
distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the<br>
party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will<br>
know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after<br>
the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,<br>
Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies<br>
Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps<br>
(such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)<br>
reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered<br>
Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br>
.<br>
(b) Contributor APIs.<br>
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming<br>
interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which<br>
are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must<br>
also include this information in the LEGAL file.<br>
.<br>
(c)    Representations.<br>
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to<br>
Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's<br>
Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or<br>
Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by<br>
this License.<br>
.<br>
3.5. Required Notices.<br>
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source<br>
Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source<br>
Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a<br>
location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely<br>
to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)<br>
You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in<br>
Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation<br>
for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership<br>
rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to<br>
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br>
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You<br>
may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial<br>
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than<br>
any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is<br>
offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial<br>
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the<br>
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,<br>
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
.<br>
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br>
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,<br>
and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of<br>
the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,<br>
including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the<br>
obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included<br>
in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or<br>
collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the<br>
Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered<br>
Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may<br>
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in<br>
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the<br>
Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's<br>
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this<br>
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different<br>
license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ<br>
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial<br>
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the<br>
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by<br>
the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such<br>
terms You offer.<br>
.<br>
3.7. Larger Works.<br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code<br>
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<br>
Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the<br>
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<br>
.<br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br>
.<br>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br>
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to<br>
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br>
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br>
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description<br>
must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must<br>
be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the<br>
extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be<br>
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to<br>
understand it.<br>
.<br>
5. Application of this License.<br>
.<br>
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<br>
attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.<br>
.<br>
6. Versions of the License.<br>
.<br>
6.1. New Versions.<br>
Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised<br>
and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version<br>
will be given a distinguishing version number.<br>
.<br>
6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the<br>
License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that<br>
version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms<br>
of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one<br>
other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to<br>
Covered Code created under this License.<br>
.<br>
6.3. Derivative Works.<br>
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may<br>
only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code<br>
governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that<br>
the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",<br>
"MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your<br>
license (except to note that your license differs from this License)<br>
and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license<br>
contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and<br>
Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial<br>
Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in<br>
Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of<br>
this License.)<br>
.<br>
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br>
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF<br>
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.<br>
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE<br>
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,<br>
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE<br>
COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER<br>
OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF<br>
ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br>
.<br>
8. TERMINATION.<br>
.<br>
8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br>
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All<br>
sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall<br>
survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their<br>
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<br>
shall survive.<br>
.<br>
8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement<br>
claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer<br>
or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom<br>
You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:<br>
.<br>
(a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly<br>
infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such<br>
Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License<br>
shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,<br>
unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)<br>
agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable<br>
royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such<br>
Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to<br>
the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days<br>
of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not<br>
mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim<br>
is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under<br>
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of<br>
the 60 day notice period specified above.<br>
.<br>
(b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's<br>
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then<br>
any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)<br>
and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,<br>
sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that<br>
Participant.<br>
.<br>
8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant<br>
alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or<br>
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as<br>
by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent<br>
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses<br>
granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken<br>
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or<br>
license.<br>
.<br>
8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,<br>
all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)<br>
which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder<br>
prior to termination shall survive termination.<br>
.<br>
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
.<br>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<br>
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL<br>
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,<br>
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR<br>
ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY<br>
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,<br>
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER<br>
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN<br>
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF<br>
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<br>
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW<br>
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br>
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO<br>
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
.<br>
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>
.<br>
The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in<br>
48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer<br>
software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such<br>
terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48<br>
C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),<br>
all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those<br>
rights set forth herein.<br>
.<br>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
.<br>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject<br>
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br>
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br>
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by<br>
California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if<br>
any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.<br>
With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,<br>
or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United<br>
States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be<br>
subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern<br>
District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,<br>
California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including<br>
without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and<br>
expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on<br>
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.<br>
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract<br>
shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this<br>
License.<br>
.<br>
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br>
.<br>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is<br>
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,<br>
out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to<br>
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such<br>
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or<br>
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<br>
.<br>
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.<br>
.<br>
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as<br>
"Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial<br>
Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under<br>
Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified<br>
by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.<br>
