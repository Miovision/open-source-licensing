This is the Debian pre-packaged version of vim.  Vim is an almost compatible<br>
version of the UNIX editor Vi.  Many new features have been added: multi level<br>
undo, syntax highlighting, command line history, on-line help, filename<br>
completion, block operations, etc.<br>
<br>
This package was put together by Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@debian.org> from<br>
sources obtained from: ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/unix/. The current maintainer<br>
is Debian VIM Maintainers <pkg-vim-maintainers@lists.alioth.debian.org>.<br>
<br>
Vim was written by Bram Moolenaar.  The following copying conditions are taken<br>
from the online documentation.<br>
<br>
<br>
I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except<br>
that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute<br>
unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must<br>
include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables<br>
that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage<br>
examples and Vim scripts.<br>
<br>
II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,<br>
including executables and/or source code, when the following four<br>
conditions are met:<br>
1) This license text must be included unmodified.<br>
2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:<br>
a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in<br>
the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you<br>
(in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you<br>
must make your changes, including source code, available to the<br>
maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to<br>
include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the<br>
maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they<br>
will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation<br>
then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.<br>
The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>.  If this<br>
changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely<br>
vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is completely<br>
impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him<br>
your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has<br>
received your changes they will not have to be sent again.<br>
b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as<br>
mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it<br>
unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the<br>
text under a) applies to those changes.<br>
c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of<br>
the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a<br>
context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you<br>
add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from<br>
making their own changes to the official version of Vim.<br>
d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned<br>
under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the<br>
changes if the following three conditions are met:<br>
- The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute<br>
the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and<br>
permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official<br>
version of Vim without fee or restriction.<br>
- You keep the changes for at least three years after last<br>
distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer<br>
or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in<br>
any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them<br>
available to him.<br>
- You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This<br>
contact information must remain valid for at least three years<br>
after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long<br>
as possible.<br>
e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,<br>
you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or<br>
any later version.<br>
3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version"<br>
command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim<br>
is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned<br>
under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does<br>
not conflict with the license used for the changes.<br>
4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be<br>
removed or changed, except that the person himself can make<br>
corrections.<br>
<br>
III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use<br>
the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the<br>
maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is<br>
by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.<br>
If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a<br>
context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is<br>
<maintainer@vim.org><br>
<br>
IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim<br>
sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this<br>
license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came<br>
with, at your option.<br>
<br>
On Debian systems the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 is located on<br>
the filesystem at /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2.<br>

otherwise explicitly stated in the document.<br>
<br>
Mere aggregation of Open Publication works or a portion of an Open Publication<br>
work with other works or programs on the same media shall not cause this<br>
license to apply to those other works. The aggregate work shall contain a<br>

<br>
<br>
V. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS<br>
<br>
In addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from and<br>
strongly recommended of redistributors that:<br>
<br>
1. If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or CD-ROM, you<br>
provide email notification to the authors of your intent to redistribute<br>
at least thirty days before your manuscript or media freeze, to give the<br>
authors time to provide updated documents. This notification should<br>
describe modifications, if any, made to the document.<br>
2. All substantive modifications (including deletions) be either clearly<br>
marked up in the document or else described in an attachment to the<br>
document.<br>
3. Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is considered<br>
good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM expression of<br>
an Open Publication-licensed work to its author(s).<br>
<br>
<br>
VI. LICENSE OPTIONS<br>
<br>
The author(s) and/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed document may<br>
elect certain options by appending language to the reference to or copy of the<br>
license. These options are considered part of the license instance and must be<br>
included with the license (or its incorporation by reference) in derived works.<br>
<br>
A. To prohibit distribution of substantively modified versions without the<br>
explicit permission of the author(s). "Substantive modification" is defined as<br>
a change to the semantic content of the document, and excludes mere changes in<br>
format or typographical corrections.<br>
<br>
To accomplish this, add the phrase `Distribution of substantively modified<br>
versions of this document is prohibited without the explicit permission of the<br>
copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.<br>
<br>
B. To prohibit any publication of this work or derivative works in whole or in<br>
part in standard (paper) book form for commercial purposes is prohibited unless<br>
prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.<br>
<br>
To accomplish this, add the phrase 'Distribution of the work or derivative of<br>
the work in any standard (paper) book form is prohibited unless prior<br>
permission is obtained from the copyright holder.' to the license reference or<br>
copy.<br>
