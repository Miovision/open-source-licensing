Alan Beale <biljir@pobox.com> also deserves special credit as he has,<br>
in addition to providing the 12Dicts package and being a major<br>
contributor to the ENABLE word list, given me an incredible amount of<br>
feedback and created a number of special lists (those found in the<br>
Supplement) in order to help improve the overall quality of SCOWL.<br>
<br>
The 10 level includes the 1000 most common English words (according to<br>
the Moby (TM) Words II [MWords] package), a subset of the 1000 most<br>
common words on the Internet (again, according to Moby Words II), and<br>
frequently class 16 from Brian Kelk's "UK English Wordlist<br>
with Frequency Classification".<br>
<br>
The MWords package was explicitly placed in the public domain:<br>
<br>
The Moby lexicon project is complete and has<br>
been place into the public domain. Use, sell,<br>
rework, excerpt and use in any way on any platform.<br>
<br>

also encouraged. The compiler is not aware of any<br>
export restrictions so freely distribute world-wide.<br>

From: Brian Kelk <Brian.Kelk@cl.cam.ac.uk><br>
<br>
> I was wondering what the copyright status of your "UK English<br>
> Wordlist With Frequency Classification" word list as it seems to<br>
> be lacking any copyright notice.<br>
<br>
There were many many sources in total, but any text marked<br>
"copyright" was avoided. Locally-written documentation was one<br>
source. An earlier version of the list resided in a filespace called<br>
PUBLIC on the University mainframe, because it was considered public<br>
domain.<br>

<br>
> So are you saying your word list is also in the public domain?<br>
<br>
That is the intention.<br>
<br>
The 20 level includes frequency classes 7-15 from Brian's word list.<br>
<br>
The 35 level includes frequency classes 2-6 and words appearing in at<br>
least 11 of 12 dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package.  All<br>
words from the 12Dicts package have had likely inflections added via<br>
my inflection database.<br>
<br>
The 12Dicts package and Supplement is in the Public Domain.<br>

<br>
The 40 level includes words from Alan's 3esl list found in version 4.0<br>
of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 3esl list is also in the<br>
public domain.<br>
<br>
The 50 level includes Brian's frequency class 1, words words appearing<br>
in at least 5 of 12 of the dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts<br>
package, and uppercase words in at least 4 of the previous 12<br>
dictionaries.  A decent number of proper names is also included: The<br>
top 1000 male, female, and Last names from the 1990 Census report; a<br>
list of names sent to me by Alan Beale; and a few names that I added<br>
myself.  Finally a small list of abbreviations not commonly found in<br>
other word lists is included.<br>
<br>
The name files form the Census report is a government document which I<br>
don't think can be copyrighted.<br>
<br>
The file special-jargon.50 uses common.lst and word.lst from the<br>
"Unofficial Jargon File Word Lists" which is derived from "The Jargon<br>
File".  All of which is in the Public Domain.  This file also contain<br>
a few extra UNIX terms which are found in the file "unix-terms" in the<br>
special/ directory.<br>
<br>
The 55 level includes words from Alan's 2of4brif list found in version<br>
4.0 of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 2of4brif is also<br>
in the public domain.<br>
<br>
The 60 level includes all words appearing in at least 2 of the 12<br>
dictionaries as indicated by the 12Dicts package.<br>
<br>
The 70 level includes Brian's frequency class 0 and the 74,550 common<br>
dictionary words from the MWords package.  The common dictionary words,<br>
like those from the 12Dicts package, have had all likely inflections<br>
added.  The 70 level also included the 5desk list from version 4.0 of<br>
the 12Dics package which is the public domain.<br>
<br>
The 80 level includes the ENABLE word list, all the lists in the<br>
ENABLE supplement package (except for ABLE), the "UK Advanced Cryptics<br>
Dictionary" (UKACD), the list of signature words in from YAWL package,<br>
and the 10,196 places list from the MWords package.<br>
<br>
The ENABLE package, mainted by MCooper <thegrendel@theriver.com>,<br>
is in the Public Domain:<br>
<br>
The ENABLE master word list, WORD.LST, is herewith formally released<br>
into the Public Domain. Anyone is free to use it or distribute it in<br>
any manner they see fit. No fee or registration is required for its<br>
use nor are "contributions" solicited (if you feel you absolutely<br>
must contribute something for your own peace of mind, the authors of<br>
the ENABLE list ask that you make a donation on their behalf to your<br>
favorite charity). This word list is our gift to the Scrabble<br>
community, as an alternate to "official" word lists. Game designers<br>
may feel free to incorporate the WORD.LST into their games. Please<br>
mention the source and credit us as originators of the list. Note<br>
that if you, as a game designer, use the WORD.LST in your product,<br>
you may still copyright and protect your product, but you may *not*<br>
legally copyright or in any way restrict redistribution of the<br>
WORD.LST portion of your product. This *may* under law restrict your<br>
rights to restrict your users' rights, but that is only fair.<br>

words, 4,946 female names and the 3,897 male names, and 21,986 names<br>
from the MWords package, ABLE.LST from the ENABLE Supplement, and some<br>
