This package contains the encodings tarball downloaded from<br>
http://xorg.freedesktop.org/releases/individual/font/<br>
<br>
The XFree86/Xorg encoding files are in the public domain.<br>
<br>
Most of these encoding files were generated by me in the winter of 1998/1998<br>
from publicly available sources (notably from data files provided by the<br>
Unicode Consortium) using a throw-away program written in Common Lisp.  Over<br>
the years, a number of people have kindly added new encoding files to the<br>
collection.<br>
<br>
If you want to add a copyright statement to an encoding file, you need<br>
your brain examined.<br>
