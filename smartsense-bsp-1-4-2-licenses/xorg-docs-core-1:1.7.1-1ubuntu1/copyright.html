Introduction<br>
<br>
The X.Org Foundation X Window System distribution is a compilation of code and<br>
documentation from many sources. This document is intended primarily as a guide<br>
to the licenses used in the distribution: you must check each file and/or<br>
package for precise redistribution terms. None-the-less, this summary may be<br>
useful to many users.<br>
<br>
This document is based on the compilation from XFree86. If you find any errors<br>
or significant omissions in this document, please contact us with details at <<br>
xorg@lists.freedesktop.org>.<br>
<br>
Most of these licenses are based on the MIT, X Consortium, or BSD (original and<br>
revised) licenses. All of them are consistent with the Open Source Definition,<br>
and most are consistent with the Free Software Foundation's Free Software<br>
Definition.<br>
<br>
While the current licenses are all open source licenses, the X.Org Foundation<br>
is attempting, over time, to bring as much as possible of the code's licenses<br>
in the distribution into compliance with the Debian Free Software Guidelines.<br>
<br>
X.Org Preferred License<br>
<br>
The X.Org Foundation has chosen the following format of the MIT License as the<br>
preferred format for code included in the X Window System distribution. This is<br>
a slight variant of the common MIT license form published by the Open Source<br>
Initiative at http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php.<br>
