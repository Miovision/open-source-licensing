This is the pre-packaged Debian Linux version of the zlib compression<br>

from sources originally retrieved from ftp.uu.net in the directory<br>
/pub/archiving/zip/zlib as the file zlib-1.0.4.tar.gz.<br>

The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz. The deflate<br>
and zlib specifications were written by Peter Deutsch. Thanks to all the<br>
people who reported problems and suggested various improvements in zlib;<br>
they are too numerous to cite here.<br>
